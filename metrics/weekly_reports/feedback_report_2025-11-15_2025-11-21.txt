Feedback comments
  - 2025-11-16T16:59:21.445874+00:00 – Animesh Anand (@animanan): This problem with guid to email conversion isn’t resolved, neither by the app nor despite clearly indicating what to use for it in the request itself
  - 2025-11-16T18:09:33.027885+00:00 – Rajeev Jain (@rkjain): You didn't analyze the full job. Why did you only review 8 lrgs?
  - 2025-11-17T02:53:17.374046+00:00 – Dheeraj Khatri (@dekhatri): The test was not generated properly. I see most of the stuff is not useful. This is an EXASCALE bug but i see the test is written for ASM/exadata.

bug description was correct but the tsc could be  a lot better.
  - 2025-11-17T12:46:34.858803+00:00 – Dheeraj Khatri (@dekhatri): Test summary and description is good but the generated test/sh script is not helpful.
  - 2025-11-17T15:14:03.287581+00:00 – Pankaj Bahl (@pbahl): The summary is not generated
  - 2025-11-20T12:51:58.077357+00:00 – Sandeep Heranjal (@saheranj): Comments are not related to the difs in the LRG, looks to be incorrect. Please help to review. 
Thanks,
Sandeep
  - 2025-11-21T08:44:33.570967+00:00 – Hardik Banthia (@habanthi): The agent provided me with list of scheds
  - 2025-11-21T09:49:36.440178+00:00 – Shreyash Chavhan (@schavhan): When i checked first label to search on orareview, I am not able to see this transaction, can you please check if this is giving right result ?
