The error code '0x2' suggests a specific failure, but without additional context or documentation, the exact cause remains ambiguous. Potential factors could include firmware incompatibilities, driver issues, or hardware malfunctions affecting the NVM subsystem. The impact on system reliability is uncertain; while the error may be benign, it could also signify underlying problems that might affect data integrity or system stability. Reproducing this behavior would require monitoring the system during NVM operations to identify any patterns or triggers. Recommended steps include updating the NVM firmware and associated drivers to the latest versions, reviewing system logs for related errors, and consulting hardware diagnostics to assess the health of the NVM device. Given the lack of explicit developer feedback and the potential involvement of Exadata-specific components, this incident should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than required lines.]", "evidence": "", "additional_sources": "", "log_window": "kernel: nmem9: security state retrieval failed (0:0x2)\nkernel: nmem9: security state retrieval failed (0:0x2)", "dev_feedback": "", "hostname": "scacac04celadm08", "viewname": "dongyzhu_daily72", "rackname": "", "deployment_type": "", "hardware": "", "session_window": "2025-10-22 07:03:09", "message_count": 8, "messages": "kernel: nmem9: security state retrieval failed (0:0x2)\nkernel: nmem9: security state retrieval failed (0:0x2)", "message_structure": "kernel: nmem<num>: security state retrieval failed (<num>:<hex>)"}
