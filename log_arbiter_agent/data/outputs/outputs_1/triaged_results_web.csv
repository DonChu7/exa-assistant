Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that the SSH daemon (sshd) on scaqat02adm01 attempted to bind to port 22 on IP address 10.214.194.173 but failed with the error 'Cannot assign requested address.' This error typically occurs when sshd is configured to listen on a specific IP address that is not currently assigned to any network interface on the system. In this case, the IP address 10.214.194.173 may not be active or assigned to any interface at the time of sshd's startup. Consequently, sshd cannot bind to this address, leading to the observed error. This situation does not necessarily indicate a critical issue affecting system reliability. If sshd is also configured to listen on other valid addresses or the wildcard address (0.0.0.0), it will continue to accept connections on those interfaces. To resolve this, ensure that the ListenAddress directive in the sshd configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) specifies only active IP addresses assigned to the system's network interfaces. Alternatively, using the wildcard address allows sshd to listen on all available interfaces, mitigating this issue. This behavior is a common configuration oversight and does not impact the overall functionality of the SSH service if other valid listening addresses are configured.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the 'exadata-virtmon.service' and 'exadata-qmpmon.service' failed to start due to systemd transaction conflicts, specifically with 'var.mount' and 'dev-disk-by\x2dlabel-SWAP.swap' jobs. These services are integral to Exadata's virtualization monitoring and management. Their failure suggests underlying issues with system resource management or service dependencies, potentially leading to degraded performance or system instability. This behavior could be reproduced by initiating service restarts during active mount or swap operations, causing transaction conflicts. To resolve this, ensure that all dependent services and mounts are correctly configured and operational before restarting these services. Additionally, review systemd logs for detailed error messages and consult Oracle support for guidance. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This error typically occurs when sshd is configured to listen on a specific IP address that is not currently assigned to any network interface on the host. In this case, the IP address 10.214.194.174 may not be active or assigned to any interface at the time of the binding attempt. This situation can arise if the IP address is dynamically assigned and not present during sshd startup, or if there is a misconfiguration in the network settings. The impact on system reliability is minimal, as sshd will continue to operate and listen on other valid addresses. To resolve this issue, ensure that the IP address specified in the 'ListenAddress' directive within the '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' file is correctly assigned to an active network interface. Alternatively, configure sshd to listen on all available interfaces by commenting out the 'ListenAddress' directive or setting it to '0.0.0.0'. After making these changes, restart the sshd service to apply the new configuration. This behavior is documented in various technical discussions and support articles, indicating it is a known and manageable issue.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate repeated attempts by the D-Bus system daemon to activate the 'dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service' unit, which is not found. This suggests that the NetworkManager-dispatcher service is either not installed, disabled, or misconfigured. The NetworkManager-dispatcher is responsible for executing scripts in response to network events, but its absence does not impede core networking functions managed by NetworkManager itself. Therefore, this issue does not impact Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability. To resolve the log messages, ensure that the NetworkManager-dispatcher service is installed and enabled, or adjust the D-Bus and systemd configurations to prevent unnecessary activation attempts. Similar issues have been discussed in various forums, indicating that this is a common and non-impacting scenario.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the systemd-logind.service failed to start due to a timeout, which is a critical issue affecting system reliability. This service is responsible for managing user logins and sessions; its failure can prevent users from logging in, disrupt session management, and impact other services that depend on it. The timeout suggests that systemd-logind is unable to communicate with the D-Bus system bus, possibly due to D-Bus not being active or accessible. This scenario can occur if the D-Bus service is not running, is misconfigured, or if there are issues with inter-process communication mechanisms. To reproduce this issue, one could stop the D-Bus service and attempt to start systemd-logind. To resolve this, ensure that the D-Bus service is running correctly and that systemd-logind can connect to it. Restarting the D-Bus service and then systemd-logind may resolve the issue. If the problem persists, further investigation into D-Bus configurations and logs is necessary. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, indicating that this is a known problem with critical implications for system functionality.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate a failure in the Mellanox mlx5 driver during the transition of a Queue Pair (QP) from INIT to Ready-to-Receive (RTR) state, resulting in a 'bad parameter' error with syndrome code 0x29e0df. This failure is accompanied by the RDS/IB subsystem's inability to set up fast registration (fastreg) resources, which are essential for efficient RDMA operations. Such errors can lead to degraded performance or complete failure of RDMA communications, directly impacting Exadata's high-speed interconnect reliability. This issue can be reproduced by attempting to establish RDMA connections under the current system configuration. To resolve this, ensure that the system is running a kernel version that supports the adapter's real-time clock functionality, as kernels prior to version 5.12 may lack this support. Alternatively, disable the REAL_TIME_CLOCK_ENABLE feature on the adapter using the Mellanox Firmware Tools (MFT) package.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate repeated attempts by the D-Bus system daemon to activate the 'dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service' unit, which is not found. This suggests that the NetworkManager-dispatcher service is either not installed, disabled, or its D-Bus service file is missing. The NetworkManager-dispatcher is responsible for executing scripts in response to network events, and its absence may prevent certain network-related scripts from running. However, core network functionality managed by NetworkManager itself should remain unaffected. To resolve this, ensure that the NetworkManager-dispatcher service is installed and enabled. If the service is not required, the error messages can be suppressed by configuring NetworkManager to avoid invoking the dispatcher. This can be achieved by adding 'systemd-resolved=false' to the '[main]' section of '/etc/NetworkManager/NetworkManager.conf'. Similar issues have been discussed in the Arch Linux forums, where users experienced D-Bus activation failures due to missing services, and adjusting NetworkManager configurations provided a solution.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate a failure in the Mellanox mlx5 driver during the transition of a Queue Pair (QP) from INIT to RTR state, resulting in a 'bad parameter' error with syndrome code 0x29e0df. This error is associated with the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) over InfiniBand (IB) protocol, as evidenced by the subsequent 'Failed to setup fastreg resources' message. Such failures can disrupt RDS communications, potentially leading to node crashes or instability in Exadata systems. Similar issues have been reported, where enabling RDS over InfiniBand led to node crashes due to kernel bugs in the RDS/IB stack. To reproduce this issue, one could attempt to initialize RDS over InfiniBand on a system with the same kernel and driver versions. Resolution steps include verifying compatibility between the mlx5 driver and firmware versions, ensuring that the RDS/IB stack is correctly configured, and applying any relevant patches or updates. Given the critical nature of this issue and its impact on Exadata reliability, it is imperative to escalate this to development for a thorough investigation and resolution. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This failure is followed by the RDS/IB subsystem's inability to set up fast registration (fastreg) resources. Such errors can stem from mismatches between the driver and firmware versions, as seen in similar cases where incorrect parameters were passed during QP creation, leading to 'bad parameter' errors. This issue can disrupt Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) operations, potentially affecting Exadata/Exascale system reliability. To reproduce, attempt to establish RDMA connections under the current driver and firmware configuration. Resolution involves verifying and updating the Mellanox driver and firmware to compatible versions, ensuring proper parameter handling during QP transitions.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd failed to activate the swap partition labeled 'SWAP' due to a dependency failure, resulting from a timeout while waiting for the device to become available. This issue is commonly associated with misconfigurations in the /etc/fstab file, such as referencing a non-existent or incorrectly labeled swap partition. The impact on system reliability is minimal, as modern systems with sufficient RAM can operate without swap space, though performance may degrade under heavy memory usage. To reproduce this behavior, one can configure an incorrect or missing swap partition label in /etc/fstab and attempt a system reboot. Resolution involves verifying the existence and correct labeling of the swap partition using tools like 'blkid' or 'lsblk', and ensuring that the /etc/fstab entry accurately reflects the correct device or UUID. Additionally, if the swap partition is no longer required, removing or commenting out the corresponding line in /etc/fstab will prevent systemd from attempting to activate it during boot. Similar issues have been reported in various distributions, indicating that this is a common and non-critical problem.

This is a common occurrence in virtualized environments or systems with multiple sockets, where TSC synchronization issues can arise. When the TSC is marked unstable, the system typically falls back to a more reliable clock source, such as the High Precision Event Timer (HPET), to maintain accurate timekeeping. While this fallback may introduce a slight performance overhead due to the higher latency of HPET compared to TSC, it does not compromise system stability or functionality.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that the SCSI device 'sdc' encountered a 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' error with 'hostbyte=DID_OK' and 'driverbyte=DRIVER_OK'. This typically occurs when a device is being removed or has already been disconnected, leading to the failure of the cache synchronization command. The 'DID_OK' and 'DRIVER_OK' statuses suggest that the command was issued successfully, but the device did not respond as expected, likely due to its absence. Such messages are common during device removal processes and do not necessarily indicate a hardware fault or system instability. To reproduce this behavior, one can manually detach a SCSI device while the system is operational. No immediate action is required, but if this message appears without intentional device removal, it would be prudent to check the device's physical connections and system logs for any unexpected disconnections.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) has marked multiple paths (sdf, sdh, sdk, sdm, sdo, sdq, sds, sdj, sdl, sdn, sdp, sdr, sdt, sdc, sdg) as failed simultaneously. This suggests a significant disruption in the storage subsystem, potentially due to a controller failure, SAN connectivity issue, or misconfiguration. Such a failure can lead to loss of redundancy and, if all paths to a device are marked as failed, complete inaccessibility of the associated storage volumes, severely impacting system reliability and availability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate a controller failover or disconnect storage paths to observe multipathd's response. Immediate investigation is required to identify the root cause, which may involve checking hardware connections, reviewing multipath configurations, and analyzing system logs for related errors. Notably, similar issues have been documented, such as in Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 1505006, where paths were marked as unusable by multipathd after a controller failover, even when the underlying path was restored. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'device-mapper: multipath: 252:16: Failing path 8:96.' indicates that the device-mapper multipath subsystem has detected a failure in one of the paths to a storage device. In a multipath configuration, multiple physical paths connect the server to storage devices to ensure redundancy and load balancing. A path failure suggests a disruption in one of these connections, which could be due to hardware issues (such as a faulty cable, HBA, or switch port), misconfigurations, or transient errors. If alternative paths are available and functioning correctly, the system can continue operations without immediate impact. However, if multiple paths fail or if the multipath configuration is not properly set up, this could lead to I/O errors, degraded performance, or even data unavailability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate a path failure by disconnecting a physical link in a controlled environment. Resolution steps include: 1) Verifying the health and connectivity of all hardware components involved in the storage path; 2) Ensuring that the multipath configuration (typically found in /etc/multipath.conf) is correctly set up for the specific storage environment; 3) Monitoring system logs for recurring path failures to identify patterns or specific hardware components that may be failing. Similar issues have been documented, such as in the Red Hat Customer Portal, which discusses path failures in device-mapper-multipath configurations. Given the potential impact on system reliability and data availability, this incident should be addressed promptly to prevent further complications.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'sync_map_state: failing sdr state 2 dmstate 2' from multipathd indicates a failure in synchronizing the state of the multipath device associated with the 'sdr' path. This issue arises when multipathd attempts to reinstate a previously failed path but does not update its internal state accordingly, leading to an immediate re-failure of the path upon the next state synchronization. This behavior has been identified and addressed in a patch submitted to the device-mapper development community, which corrects the internal state update during path reinstatement to prevent such failures. The impact of this issue is significant, as it can lead to persistent path failures, potentially degrading the redundancy and reliability of the storage subsystem. To reproduce this issue, one can manually fail a path and then attempt to reinstate it without applying the aforementioned patch. The recommended resolution is to apply the patch that ensures multipathd updates its internal state correctly during path reinstatement.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'device-mapper: multipath: 252:19: Failing path 65:16.' indicates that the device-mapper multipath subsystem has detected a failure in one of the paths to a storage device. In a multipath configuration, multiple physical paths connect the server to storage devices to ensure redundancy and load balancing. A path failure suggests a disruption in one of these connections, which could be due to hardware issues (such as a faulty cable, HBA, or switch), firmware bugs, or misconfigurations. If the multipath setup has sufficient redundant paths, the system may continue to operate without immediate impact. However, if multiple paths fail or if the configuration lacks redundancy, this could lead to storage access issues, potentially causing data unavailability or loss. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate a path failure by disconnecting a physical link in a controlled environment. Resolution steps include: 1) Inspecting hardware components along the affected path for faults; 2) Verifying and updating firmware versions of HBAs and storage devices; 3) Reviewing and correcting multipath configuration settings, ensuring that the 'path_checker' and 'failback' parameters are appropriately set; 4) Monitoring system logs for recurring path failures to identify patterns. Similar issues have been discussed in community forums, where hardware faults and configuration errors were identified as common causes of path failures. Given the potential impact on storage reliability, this incident should be addressed promptly to prevent data access disruptions.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the device-mapper multipath subsystem has detected failures on paths 8:160 and 8:192, corresponding to specific SCSI devices. This suggests that two paths to the storage device have become unavailable, potentially due to hardware issues, misconfigurations, or transient errors in the storage network. Such path failures can lead to degraded performance and, if all paths fail, complete loss of access to the storage device, severely impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting specific storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Resolution steps include verifying the physical connections, checking for hardware faults in HBAs or switches, ensuring that the multipath configuration in /etc/multipath.conf is correctly set up for the storage array, and consulting storage vendor documentation for specific configuration requirements. Additionally, reviewing system logs for related errors and updating firmware and drivers to the latest versions can help mitigate this issue. Similar cases have been reported where path failures were due to misconfigurations or hardware issues, emphasizing the need for thorough diagnostics and adherence to vendor guidelines.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'sync_map_state: failing sdk state 2 dmstate 2' from multipathd indicates a failure in synchronizing the state of the device 'sdk' within the device-mapper multipath subsystem. This issue arises when multipathd attempts to reinstate a previously failed path but does not update its internal state accordingly, leading to an immediate re-failure of the path upon the next state synchronization. This behavior has been identified and addressed in a patch by Martin Wilck, which corrects the internal state update during path reinstatement to prevent such failures. The impact of this issue is significant, as it can lead to persistent path failures, potentially degrading the redundancy and reliability of the storage subsystem. To resolve this, it is recommended to apply the patch that ensures proper state synchronization during path reinstatement. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'device-mapper: multipath: 252:18: Failing path 8:160.' indicates that the Device Mapper Multipath subsystem has detected a failure on the path corresponding to major:minor device number 8:160. This failure suggests a loss of connectivity or an error condition on one of the physical paths to the storage device. In a multipath configuration, such path failures can lead to degraded performance and, if multiple paths fail, potential loss of access to the storage device. The issue could stem from hardware faults, such as a malfunctioning HBA, cable issues, or problems on the storage array side. It may also result from software misconfigurations or bugs within the multipath daemon or related components. To reproduce this behavior, one could simulate a path failure by disconnecting a physical link or disabling a path in the multipath configuration. Resolution steps include verifying the physical connections, checking the health of HBAs and storage devices, reviewing multipath configurations for correctness, and ensuring that all related software components are up to date. Similar issues have been documented, such as in Red Hat's knowledge base, where path failures were observed due to software updates affecting multipath functionality.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'sync_map_state: failing sdh state 2 dmstate 2' from multipathd indicates that the device mapper multipath daemon is failing to synchronize the state of the path associated with device sdh. This issue is often linked to a known bug where paths that are manually reinstated can be immediately failed again due to outdated internal path states within multipathd. This behavior can lead to I/O disruptions and degraded performance, particularly in environments relying on multipath configurations for redundancy and load balancing. The problem can be reproduced by manually failing and then reinstating paths, which triggers the flawed state synchronization. To resolve this, ensure that the multipathd package is updated to include patches addressing this bug, such as the one discussed in the dm-devel mailing list. Additionally, reviewing and adjusting the multipath configuration to prevent premature path failure upon reinstatement may mitigate the issue.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'device-mapper: multipath: 252:17: Failing path 8:112.' indicates that the device-mapper multipath subsystem has detected a failure on the path corresponding to major:minor device number 8:112. This failure suggests that one of the physical paths to a storage device has become unavailable, which can compromise the redundancy and reliability of the storage subsystem. Such path failures can result from hardware issues (e.g., faulty cables, HBA failures), misconfigurations, or software bugs. In environments like Exadata/Exascale, where high availability and performance are paramount, path failures can lead to degraded performance or, in worst-case scenarios, data unavailability if alternative paths are also compromised. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate a path failure by disconnecting a physical link or disabling a port on a switch. Resolution steps include: 1) Verifying the physical connectivity and health of the storage paths, 2) Ensuring that the multipath configuration is correct and up-to-date, 3) Checking for and applying any relevant firmware or driver updates, and 4) Monitoring system logs for recurring path failures to identify patterns or persistent issues.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'tsc: Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized' indicates that the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) across CPUs is not synchronized, leading the kernel to mark the TSC as unstable. This condition forces the system to switch to a less efficient clocksource, such as the High Precision Event Timer (HPET), which can significantly degrade performance. Such issues are often observed in systems with multiple sockets or NUMA nodes, where TSC synchronization challenges arise due to hardware design or BIOS configurations. For instance, on systems with many sockets, kernel timekeeping may fallback from using the inexpensive core-level TSCs to the expensive legacy socket HPET, notably impacting application performance until the system is rebooted. This may be triggered by adverse workloads generating considerable coherency or processor mesh congestion. This behavior can be reproduced by booting the system and observing the kernel logs for TSC synchronization errors. To mitigate this issue, ensure that the system's BIOS is up-to-date and configured correctly to support TSC synchronization across all CPUs.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that the 'systemd-vconsole-setup' service encountered an 'Invalid argument' error while attempting to retrieve font metadata using the 'KD_FONT_OP_GET' operation. This issue is commonly associated with the framebuffer console driver ('fbcon') being configured for deferred takeover, which delays its initialization until a message is sent to the default boot console. Consequently, 'systemd-vconsole-setup' attempts to set the font on a console that does not yet support this operation, leading to the observed error. This behavior does not impact the overall reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system, as it pertains solely to virtual console font settings. The issue can be reproduced by booting with the 'fbcon' driver set to deferred takeover. To mitigate this, add the 'fbcon=nodefer' kernel command-line option, which forces immediate takeover by the framebuffer console driver, thereby preventing the error. This can be achieved by executing: 'sudo grubby --update-kernel=DEFAULT --args=""fbcon=nodefer""'. This solution is documented in Oracle's release notes for Oracle Linux 10.0.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'Failed unmounting /tmp' indicates that during system shutdown, the /tmp directory could not be unmounted, likely due to active processes or open files within it. This is a common occurrence in Linux systems and typically does not impact system reliability or availability. The failure to unmount /tmp is often caused by lingering processes that hold files open, preventing the unmount operation. This behavior can be reproduced by initiating a shutdown while processes are still accessing /tmp. To mitigate this, ensure that all applications and services are properly terminated before shutdown.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'tsc: Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized' indicates that the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) has been deemed unreliable due to unsynchronized TSCs across CPUs. This issue is prevalent in systems with multiple sockets or NUMA nodes, where TSC discrepancies can arise from hardware design or BIOS configurations. When the TSC is marked unstable, the system defaults to alternative, less efficient clocksources like the High Precision Event Timer (HPET), leading to significant performance degradation. This behavior can be reproduced by booting multi-socket systems with unsynchronized TSCs, especially under heavy workloads. To mitigate this, ensure that the BIOS is updated to the latest version, as some BIOS versions have known issues causing TSC instability. Additionally, kernel parameters such as 'tsc=unstable' can be used to force the system to recognize the TSC as unstable, though this is more of a workaround than a solution.

Such behavior can occur due to race conditions during high I/O loads, where paths are removed or fail during state synchronization, causing multipathd to mismanage path states. This issue has been documented in similar contexts, such as Ubuntu Bug #2039719, where multipath devices were not removed correctly under high load conditions. To mitigate this, ensure that the multipath configuration is optimized for the specific storage environment, including appropriate settings for path checking and failover policies. Additionally, consider updating the multipath-tools package to incorporate recent fixes addressing such race conditions. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'sync_map_state: failing sdk state 2 dmstate 2' from multipathd indicates a failure in synchronizing the device mapper state for the path associated with device 'sdk'. This issue arises when multipathd attempts to reinstate a previously failed path but does not update its internal state accordingly, leading to an immediate re-failure of the path. This behavior has been identified and addressed in a patch submitted on July 1, 2025, which corrects the internal state update during path reinstatement. The failure to properly reinstate paths can result in I/O disruptions and reduced redundancy, impacting the reliability and availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. To reproduce this issue, manually fail a path and then attempt to reinstate it without the aforementioned patch applied.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'tsc: Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized' indicates that the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) has been deemed unreliable due to unsynchronized TSCs across CPUs. This condition can lead to the kernel switching from the TSC to a less efficient clocksource, such as the High Precision Event Timer (HPET), resulting in significant performance degradation. The root cause is often related to hardware configurations, particularly in systems with multiple sockets or NUMA nodes, where TSC synchronization issues are more prevalent. This behavior can be reproduced under workloads that induce high coherency traffic or processor mesh congestion, leading to TSC desynchronization. To mitigate this issue, ensure that the system's BIOS is up to date and configured correctly to support TSC synchronization across all CPUs. Additionally, consider applying kernel patches that address TSC stability in multi-socket systems. For instance, a patch has been proposed to prevent unexpected TSC to HPET fallback on many-socket systems, which may be relevant in this context.

This behavior is typical during shutdown sequences when systemd is terminating services and sockets, and new service start requests are inherently contradictory to the ongoing shutdown process. Such messages are generally benign and do not signify an underlying issue affecting system reliability. No immediate action is required, as this is expected behavior during system shutdown.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the 'exadata-netdiag-dump.service' failed to start, accompanied by a failure to unmount '/proc/xen'. The 'exadata-netdiag-dump.service' is integral to Exadata's network diagnostics, and its failure suggests a disruption in network diagnostic capabilities. The failure to unmount '/proc/xen' is often associated with issues in Xen-based environments, where the 'xenfs' filesystem mounted at '/proc/xen' can cause unmounting problems if not handled correctly. This behavior has been documented in various Linux distributions, where improper handling of '/proc/xen' leads to unmounting failures during shutdown or service restarts. The concurrent failure of 'exadata-netdiag-dump.service' and the unmounting issue points to a potential misconfiguration or bug in the system's handling of Xen-specific filesystems, which could impact the reliability of network diagnostics on Exadata systems. To reproduce this issue, one could attempt to start the 'exadata-netdiag-dump.service' in an environment where '/proc/xen' is mounted, and observe the failure. Resolution may involve ensuring that '/proc/xen' is correctly managed during service operations, possibly by modifying service dependencies or mount configurations. Given the involvement of Exadata-specific components, this incident should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that the NMI watchdog failed to create a performance event on CPU 0, resulting in its permanent disablement, and that the PM-Timer failed a consistency check, leading to its abortion. The NMI watchdog failure is commonly observed in environments lacking a Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) or where the PMU is unsupported, such as in certain virtualized systems or specific hardware configurations. This issue is documented in Red Hat Bugzilla (Bug 676527) and the Linux Kernel Mailing List, where similar errors have been reported without significant impact on system stability. The PM-Timer consistency check failure suggests a potential issue with the system's power management timer, but in many cases, this does not lead to critical system failures. Given that these errors are often benign and do not affect the overall reliability or availability of Exadata/Exascale systems, they can typically be ignored. However, if there are accompanying symptoms such as system instability or performance degradation, further investigation would be warranted.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that the NMI watchdog failed to create a performance event on CPU 0, resulting in its permanent disablement, and that the PM-Timer failed a consistency check, leading to its abortion. The NMI watchdog failure is commonly observed in systems lacking a Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) or when the PMU is unsupported, as seen in Red Hat Bug 676527. This failure does not impact system stability but disables the NMI watchdog's ability to detect hard lockups. The PM-Timer consistency check failure suggests a hardware issue with the timer, which could affect timekeeping accuracy. However, modern systems often have multiple timers, and the kernel can switch to alternative timers, mitigating potential impacts. To reproduce the NMI watchdog issue, one could attempt to enable it on hardware without a supported PMU. For the PM-Timer issue, testing on the same hardware configuration would be necessary. Resolution steps include verifying hardware compatibility and ensuring that the system's firmware and kernel are up to date. Given that these issues do not critically affect system reliability, they can be considered benign in the context of Exadata/Exascale systems.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the kdump service on host 'scaqae12adm03' failed to initialize due to an inability to open the Xen control interface, followed by a failure to load the kdump kernel via kexec. This suggests that the system is running as a Xen virtual machine, and the kdump service is attempting to interact with the Xen hypervisor. The failure to open the Xen control interface implies that the necessary Xen tools or permissions are not properly configured, preventing kdump from communicating with the hypervisor. Consequently, kexec cannot load the crash kernel, rendering the kdump mechanism inoperative. This failure compromises the system's ability to capture kernel crash dumps, which are essential for diagnosing and resolving critical system issues. To reproduce this issue, one could configure kdump on a Xen virtual machine without ensuring that the Xen control interface is accessible and properly configured. Resolution steps include verifying that the Xen tools are installed and correctly configured, ensuring that the kdump service has the necessary permissions to access the Xen control interface, and confirming that the kexec utility is compatible with the current kernel and hypervisor versions. Additionally, consulting the Xen and kdump documentation for specific configuration requirements is advisable. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the kdump service failed to initialize due to an inability to open the Xen control interface, followed by a failure to load the kdump kernel via kexec. This suggests that the system is attempting to utilize Xen hypervisor interfaces, which are not present or accessible, leading to the failure of the crash dump mechanism. The root cause is likely a misconfiguration where the kdump service is configured to interact with Xen-specific components on a non-Xen system. This misconfiguration prevents the kdump service from capturing kernel crash dumps, which is critical for diagnosing system failures. To reproduce this issue, configure kdump on a system without Xen support while enabling Xen-specific options. Resolution involves reviewing and correcting the kdump configuration to ensure it aligns with the system's environment, specifically by disabling Xen-related settings if Xen is not in use.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate failures in the Xen vif-bridge script when attempting to remove virtual interfaces (vif1.0 and vif1.1) from network bridges (vmbondeth0 and vmeth0) and bringing these interfaces down. These errors typically occur during the shutdown or migration of virtual machines (VMs) when the vif-bridge script executes cleanup operations. If the virtual interfaces have already been removed or are no longer present, subsequent attempts to delete them from the bridge or bring them down will fail, resulting in these log messages. This behavior is generally benign and does not impact the reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. To reproduce this behavior, one can manually remove a virtual interface from a bridge and then attempt to execute the vif-bridge script to remove it again, which should result in similar error messages. No immediate action is required, but if these messages are frequent and cause concern, reviewing the vif-bridge script for error handling improvements or adjusting logging verbosity may help reduce unnecessary log noise.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate failures in the Xen vif-bridge script when attempting to remove virtual interfaces (vif6.0 and vif6.1) from network bridges (vmbondeth0 and vmeth0) and bringing them down. These errors typically occur during the shutdown or destruction of a virtual machine (VM) when the associated virtual interfaces are already removed or do not exist. The 'brctl delif' and 'ifconfig down' commands fail because the interfaces are absent, leading to these benign error messages. This behavior is common in Xen environments and does not impact the reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. No immediate action is required, but if these messages are undesirable, modifying the vif-bridge script to check for the existence of interfaces before attempting operations can suppress them. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and does not require further development review.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate failures in the Xen vif-bridge script when attempting to remove virtual interfaces (vif7.0 and vif7.1) from network bridges (vmeth0 and vmbondeth0) and bringing them down. These errors typically occur during the shutdown or destruction of a virtual machine (VM) when the associated virtual interfaces are already removed or no longer exist. The vif-bridge script attempts to execute 'brctl delif' and 'ifconfig down' commands on these interfaces, resulting in failure messages if the interfaces are absent. This behavior is generally benign and does not impact the overall functionality or reliability of the Xen environment.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate failures in the 'vif-bridge' script attempting to remove virtual interfaces 'vif8.0' and 'vif8.1' from bridges 'vmeth0' and 'vmbondeth0', respectively, and to bring these interfaces down using 'ifconfig'. These errors typically occur when the virtual interfaces are already absent from the bridges or are not active, possibly due to prior manual removal or system state changes. Such messages are generally benign and do not impact the stability or functionality of the Xen networking stack. To prevent these warnings, ensure that the 'vif-bridge' script includes checks to verify the presence and state of interfaces before attempting operations. This behavior is common in Xen environments and does not indicate a critical issue.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the virtual network interfaces (vif11.0 and vif11.1) within the Xen environment have encountered 'Guest Rx stalled' errors. This condition arises when the guest domain (domU) fails to provide sufficient receive (Rx) slots for incoming network packets, leading to a stall in the receive path. Such stalls can result in network connectivity issues, including packet loss and potential unresponsiveness of the virtual machine. This behavior has been observed in various Xen environments and is often associated with specific kernel versions or configurations. For instance, a similar issue was reported in Debian Bug #783063, where upgrading the dom0 kernel led to domU freezes accompanied by 'Guest Rx stalled' messages. To reproduce this issue, one might run a Xen domU with a kernel version known to exhibit this behavior and monitor for the 'Guest Rx stalled' messages in the dom0 logs. Resolution steps include updating both dom0 and domU to the latest stable kernel versions, ensuring that all relevant patches addressing this issue are applied. Additionally, reviewing and adjusting network configurations, such as disabling Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) and TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) on the domU, may mitigate the problem. Given the critical nature of this issue, it is imperative to address it promptly to maintain the reliability and availability of the Exadata/Exascale environment.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'vif vif-12-0 vif12.0: Guest Rx stalled' indicates that the virtual network interface (VIF) associated with a Xen guest domain (domU) has detected a receive (Rx) stall. This condition suggests that the guest's network driver is not processing incoming packets promptly, leading to potential network disruptions or complete loss of connectivity for the affected virtual machine. Such stalls can result from various issues, including guest driver malfunctions, resource exhaustion, or compatibility problems between the host and guest network configurations. Similar incidents have been reported in environments running XenServer and other Xen-based platforms, where guests experience periodic freezes or network interruptions accompanied by 'Guest Rx stalled' messages. To reproduce this issue, one might simulate high network load or introduce driver anomalies within the guest. Resolution steps include verifying the guest's network driver integrity, ensuring compatibility between host and guest network configurations, and considering updates or patches that address known issues related to VIF stalls. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate failures in the Xen vif-bridge script when attempting to remove virtual interfaces (vif14.0 and vif14.1) from network bridges (vmeth0 and vmbondeth0) and bringing them down. These errors suggest potential issues in the virtual network interface management within the Xen environment. Possible causes include misconfigurations in the network bridge setup, such as incorrect bridge names or missing bridges, or the absence of necessary backend drivers like 'xen-netback' in the dom0 kernel. This behavior can lead to network connectivity problems for virtual machines, affecting their communication and overall system reliability. To reproduce the issue, attempt to remove virtual interfaces from bridges using the vif-bridge script under the current network configuration. Resolution steps involve verifying the existence and correct configuration of the specified bridges, ensuring that the 'xen-netback' module is loaded in the dom0 kernel, and reviewing the Xen networking scripts for any inconsistencies. Additionally, consulting the Xen hotplug logs located at '/var/log/xen/xen-hotplug.log' may provide more detailed information about the failures. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that the 'systemd-networkd-wait-online.service' failed to start due to a dependency failure, specifically because the 'systemd-networkd.service' was not active. This situation commonly arises when 'systemd-networkd' is not enabled or is inactive, often in environments where an alternative network management service, such as NetworkManager, is in use. In such configurations, 'systemd-networkd-wait-online.service' is unnecessary and its failure does not impact system functionality. To resolve this, you can disable the 'systemd-networkd-wait-online.service' by executing 'systemctl disable --now systemd-networkd-wait-online.service'. This action prevents the service from attempting to start, thereby eliminating the associated error messages. This behavior is documented in various community discussions, such as the Caddy Community forum, where users have encountered similar issues when 'systemd-networkd' is not active. Therefore, this incident is considered benign and does not affect the reliability or availability of the system.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'systemd-logind: Failed to abandon session scope: Connection reset by peer' indicates that during the termination of a user session, systemd-logind encountered a transient communication issue with the D-Bus system message bus, resulting in a 'Connection reset by peer' error. This error typically arises when the D-Bus service is restarted or becomes temporarily unavailable during the session closure process. Such occurrences are generally benign and do not impact the overall reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. The behavior can be reproduced by manually restarting the D-Bus service while active user sessions are present, leading to similar log messages upon session termination. No specific resolution is required, as this is a known behavior within systemd-logind's interaction with D-Bus during session management. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, indicating that this is a common and non-impacting occurrence.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that during the system shutdown process, the systemd-networkd.socket unit failed to queue a service startup job due to a 'Transaction is destructive' error, leading to the unit entering a failed state. This behavior is a known characteristic of systemd during shutdown sequences, where attempts to start services are blocked to prevent conflicts with the ongoing shutdown process.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'Failed unmounting /proc/xen' indicates that during the shutdown process, systemd attempted to unmount the /proc/xen directory but encountered an issue. This directory is typically associated with Xen hypervisor environments, and its presence or absence depends on whether the system is running as a Xen guest or host. In non-Xen environments, this directory may not exist, leading to such unmounting failures during shutdown. This behavior is generally benign and does not impact system reliability or availability. To suppress these messages, you can create a systemd override for the unmount operation to ignore errors related to /proc/xen. This approach has been discussed in various forums where similar unmounting issues were observed during shutdown sequences. For instance, in a Debian bug report, users noted that systemd attempted to unmount non-existent directories, resulting in similar log messages. Implementing an override to handle such cases can prevent these benign errors from appearing in logs.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'PM-Timer failed consistency check (0xffffff) - aborting.' indicates that the system's Power Management Timer (PM-Timer) failed a consistency check during initialization. This message is commonly observed in virtualized environments, particularly with Xen hypervisors, where the PM-Timer is under the control of the hypervisor and cannot be accessed by guest systems, including dom0. As a result, the kernel logs this message when it detects the inability to utilize the PM-Timer. This behavior is documented in SUSE's knowledge base, which states that this error message does not indicate any failure condition and can be safely ignored. The presence of this message does not impact the reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. No specific misconfiguration is implied, and no corrective action is necessary. The system will continue to function correctly using alternative timing sources. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and does not require further review by development.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The systemd-sysctl errors indicate attempts to set sysctl parameters for kernel modules or network interfaces that are not present or loaded. Specifically, the absence of files like '/proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables' suggests that the 'br_netfilter' module is not loaded, which is common if bridge filtering is not required. Similarly, missing '/proc/sys/net/rds/ib/yield_after_ms' points to the 'rds' module being unloaded, and the absence of '/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/eth0/accept_ra' implies that the 'eth0' interface does not support IPv6 or is not configured for it. These messages are benign and do not impact system functionality. To suppress these warnings, ensure that sysctl configurations align with the active kernel modules and network interfaces. For instance, if bridge filtering is unnecessary, remove or comment out related sysctl settings. This behavior is documented in various forums where users encounter similar messages due to unloaded modules or unconfigured interfaces.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that certain systemd services, such as dracut-pre-trigger.service and dracut-initqueue.service, are not starting due to unmet conditions specified in their unit files. Specifically, the conditions 'ConditionKernelCommandLine=|rd.break=pre-trigger' and 'ConditionPathExistsGlob=|/lib/dracut/hooks/initqueue/online/*.sh' are not satisfied, leading to the services being skipped. This behavior is expected and non-impacting, as these services are designed to start only when specific conditions are met, typically during specialized boot scenarios like rescue or emergency modes. The absence of these conditions during a normal boot process results in the services being bypassed without affecting system functionality.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The systemd-sysctl service is attempting to set kernel parameters related to bridge netfilter settings, but the corresponding files in /proc/sys/net/bridge/ are missing, resulting in 'No such file or directory' errors. This typically occurs when the br_netfilter kernel module is not loaded, as it is responsible for creating these sysctl entries. The absence of this module means that bridge traffic is not being passed through iptables for filtering, which is the default behavior on many systems. This issue does not impact the core functionality or reliability of Exadata/Exascale systems unless specific configurations require bridge traffic filtering. To resolve the errors, load the br_netfilter module using 'modprobe br_netfilter' and ensure it loads at boot by adding it to /etc/modules-load.d/ or /etc/modules. However, if bridge traffic filtering is not required, these errors can be safely ignored. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and does not require further development review.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd-udevd failed to insert the IPMI kernel modules ('ipmi_si', 'ipmi_devintf', 'ipmi_msghandler') on host 'scaqae12adm03'. This typically occurs when the system lacks a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) or when the BMC is not properly configured. Without a BMC, IPMI functionality is unavailable, but this does not impact the core operations of Exadata/Exascale systems, as IPMI is primarily used for remote hardware management. To confirm the absence of a BMC, execute 'dmidecode | grep -i ipmi'. If no output is returned, the system does not have a BMC, and these error messages can be safely ignored. If a BMC is present but not recognized, ensure that the BIOS is correctly configured to report the IPMI device. Additionally, manually loading the IPMI modules with specific parameters may be necessary, as detailed in Oracle's documentation on configuring the Open IPMI driver.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'systemd-networkd: Event loop failed: Transport endpoint is not connected' indicates a failure in the systemd-networkd service's event loop, leading to its termination. This error suggests an underlying issue with the service's ability to maintain its event-driven operations, potentially due to misconfigurations, resource limitations, or software bugs. Such a failure can disrupt network management functions, affecting system connectivity and reliability. Similar issues have been observed in other systemd components, where services fail to start or operate correctly due to misconfigurations or environmental factors. To reproduce this issue, one might simulate conditions that disrupt the event loop, such as altering network configurations or introducing resource constraints. Resolution steps include reviewing systemd-networkd configurations, ensuring all dependencies are correctly set up, and checking for updates or patches that address known bugs. Given the critical nature of this failure, immediate attention is required to restore network management functionality.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'PM-Timer failed consistency check (0xffffff) - aborting.' indicates that the system's Power Management Timer (PM-Timer) failed a consistency check during initialization. This message is commonly observed in environments where the PM-Timer is inaccessible to the operating system, such as when running under a hypervisor like Xen. In these scenarios, the hypervisor controls the PM-Timer, rendering it unavailable to guest operating systems, including dom0. Consequently, the kernel logs this message upon detecting the inaccessibility. Importantly, this behavior does not impact system reliability or availability, as the kernel defaults to alternative timing sources when the PM-Timer is unavailable. Therefore, this message can be safely ignored in virtualized environments. No specific resolution is required unless there are accompanying symptoms indicating timing issues. This behavior is documented in SUSE's knowledge base, which states that the error message does not indicate any failure condition and can be safely ignored.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The systemd-sysctl errors indicate attempts to set kernel parameters for network subsystems that are not currently loaded or available. Specifically, the absence of files like '/proc/sys/net/bridge/bridge-nf-call-iptables' suggests that the 'br_netfilter' module is not loaded, which is required for these sysctl settings to take effect. Similarly, the missing '/proc/sys/net/rds/ib/yield_after_ms' indicates that the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) module is not present. These messages are benign and do not impact system functionality; they occur because systemd-sysctl applies settings from configuration files without verifying the presence of corresponding kernel modules. To suppress these warnings, ensure that the necessary modules are loaded before applying sysctl settings or adjust the configuration to match the active kernel modules.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that certain systemd services, such as dracut-pre-trigger.service and dracut-initqueue.service, are not starting due to unmet conditions specified in their unit files. These conditions, like 'ConditionKernelCommandLine=|rd.break=pre-trigger' and 'ConditionPathExistsGlob=|/lib/dracut/hooks/initqueue/online/*.sh', are designed to control the execution of these services based on specific kernel command-line parameters or the presence of certain files. The failure of these conditions simply means that the criteria for starting these services are not met, which is expected behavior in many scenarios. For instance, the 'rd.break' parameter is typically used for debugging purposes, and its absence during normal boot processes will prevent the associated services from starting, as intended. Similarly, the absence of specific scripts in the '/lib/dracut/hooks/initqueue/' directory will cause the related conditions to fail, leading to the non-starting of the dracut-initqueue.service. This behavior does not indicate a malfunction or misconfiguration but rather the correct operation of systemd's conditional service activation. There is no impact on system reliability or availability, and no action is required. This pattern is common in systems utilizing dracut and systemd, and similar behaviors have been observed in various Linux distributions without adverse effects.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The systemd-sysctl service is attempting to set kernel parameters related to bridge netfilter settings, but the corresponding files in /proc/sys/net/bridge/ are missing, resulting in 'No such file or directory' errors. This typically occurs when the 'br_netfilter' kernel module is not loaded, as it is responsible for creating these sysctl entries. The absence of this module means that bridge traffic is not being filtered by iptables, which is the default behavior on many systems and does not impact normal operations unless specific bridge filtering is required. To resolve these errors, load the 'br_netfilter' module using 'modprobe br_netfilter' and ensure it loads at boot by adding it to '/etc/modules-load.d/' or '/etc/modules'. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and is considered benign.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that systemd-udevd failed to insert the IPMI kernel modules ('ipmi_si', 'ipmi_devintf', and 'ipmi_msghandler') on the host 'scaqae12adm03'. This typically occurs when the system lacks a Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) or when the BMC is not properly configured. Without a BMC, IPMI functionality is unavailable, rendering these modules unnecessary. Consequently, the failure to load these modules does not impact system reliability or availability. To confirm the absence of a BMC, execute 'dmidecode | grep -i ipmi'. If no output is returned, the system does not have a BMC, and these log messages can be safely ignored. If IPMI functionality is required, ensure that the hardware includes a BMC and that it is correctly configured.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The systemd logs indicate failures to load configurations for 'run.mount', 'run-user.mount', and 'session-80.scope', all citing 'No such file or directory'. These messages typically occur when systemd attempts to manage units that are either transient or have been removed, leading to benign errors during its operation. For instance, 'session-80.scope' likely pertains to a user session that has ended, and systemd's attempt to reference its configuration post-termination results in this error. Similarly, 'run.mount' and 'run-user.mount' are associated with runtime directories that may not exist at the time of systemd's processing, especially if they are dynamically created and removed. Such errors are common in systemd environments and do not indicate a malfunction or misconfiguration. They do not impact the reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. No specific reproduction steps are necessary, as this behavior is inherent to systemd's management of transient units. No corrective actions are required.

Severity Assessment: Unclear – The provided logs indicate that the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd.service) failed to start, with systemd reporting the service entered a failed state. However, the logs lack specific error messages that would pinpoint the root cause. Common issues leading to such failures include misconfigurations in the sshd_config file, such as syntax errors or unsupported options, incorrect file permissions, or conflicts with other services binding to port 22. For instance, a syntax error in sshd_config can prevent sshd from starting, as noted in Red Hat's documentation. Additionally, if another service is occupying port 22, sshd will fail to bind to it, resulting in startup failure. To diagnose the issue, it's recommended to check the system logs using 'journalctl -xe' and inspect the sshd configuration file for errors. Adjusting the configuration or resolving port conflicts should restore the SSH service functionality.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the OpenSSH server daemon (sshd.service) failed to start, with systemd reporting the service entered a failed state. This failure can result from several critical issues: (1) Port 22 being occupied by another service, preventing sshd from binding to its default port; (2) Syntax errors or misconfigurations in the /etc/ssh/sshd_config file, such as unsupported options or incorrect settings; (3) Incorrect file permissions or SELinux contexts on SSH-related files, leading to access denials; (4) Missing or improperly configured host keys, causing sshd to terminate. The impact of this failure is significant, as it prevents remote SSH access, potentially isolating the system from remote management and maintenance. To reproduce this issue, one could intentionally misconfigure the sshd_config file, occupy port 22 with another service, or alter file permissions to restrictive settings. Resolution steps include: verifying that port 22 is free using 'ss -tunlp | grep 22' and stopping any conflicting services; checking the sshd_config file for syntax errors with 'sshd -t' and correcting any issues; ensuring correct permissions and SELinux contexts on SSH files, particularly that /etc/ssh/sshd_config is owned by root and has appropriate permissions; and confirming the presence and validity of SSH host keys in /etc/ssh/. These steps are supported by various authoritative sources, including Red Hat's documentation on SSH service failures and community discussions on similar issues.

Common issues leading to such failures include misconfigurations in the sshd_config file, incorrect file permissions, SELinux policy violations, or port conflicts. For instance, a syntax error in sshd_config can prevent the service from starting, as noted in Red Hat's documentation. Similarly, improper permissions on /etc/ssh/sshd_config can lead to 'Permission denied' errors, as discussed in Unix & Linux Stack Exchange. To diagnose the issue, it's recommended to check the status of the sshd service using 'systemctl status sshd.service' and review detailed logs with 'journalctl -xeu sshd.service'. Additionally, verifying the syntax of the sshd_config file with 'sshd -t' and ensuring that port 22 is not occupied by another service can help identify the problem. Without more detailed logs or error messages, it's challenging to determine the exact cause and impact on system reliability. Therefore, further investigation is necessary to classify the severity of this incident.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'systemd-logind[19173]: Failed to abandon session scope: Connection reset by peer' indicates that systemd-logind encountered an issue while attempting to release a session scope, resulting in a 'Connection reset by peer' error. This message typically arises when systemd-logind tries to communicate with the D-Bus system message bus, but the connection is unexpectedly closed or reset. Such occurrences are often transient and can be attributed to the D-Bus daemon restarting or experiencing a brief disruption. In most cases, this does not impact the overall functionality or reliability of the system, as systemd-logind is designed to handle such scenarios gracefully. However, if this message appears frequently or is accompanied by other systemd-related errors, it may indicate underlying issues with the D-Bus service or inter-process communication mechanisms. To mitigate this, ensure that the D-Bus service is running correctly and consider restarting it if necessary. Additionally, reviewing system logs for related errors can provide further insights into potential causes. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where users observed 'Failed to abandon session scope' messages due to D-Bus connection problems, often without significant impact on system operations.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that during the system shutdown process, the systemd-networkd.socket unit failed to queue a service startup job due to a 'Transaction is destructive' error. This situation arises because systemd is in the process of stopping services as part of the shutdown sequence, and any attempt to start a service during this phase is inherently contradictory. Such messages are typical during shutdown and do not signify a malfunction or misconfiguration. They are part of systemd's normal operation, ensuring that services are properly terminated. Therefore, these messages can be safely ignored as they do not impact the reliability or availability of the system.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The failure of the exadata-netdiag-dump.service indicates a malfunction in the Exadata network diagnostics dump service, which is essential for collecting and analyzing network diagnostic data. This failure could impede the ability to perform network diagnostics, potentially affecting the reliability and availability of the Exadata system. The accompanying failure to unmount /var/log suggests that the service may be attempting to access or modify log files during its operation, and the inability to unmount indicates that the filesystem is busy or locked, possibly due to the service's failure. This behavior could be reproduced by manually starting the exadata-netdiag-dump.service and observing its interaction with the /var/log filesystem. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to investigate the service's logs for specific error messages, ensure that all dependencies are correctly configured, and verify that the /var/log filesystem is not being accessed by other processes during the service's operation. Given the critical nature of this service in maintaining Exadata's network diagnostics, prompt attention is required to restore its functionality.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The repeated systemd log entries 'Failed to enqueue SYSTEMD_WANTS= job, ignoring: Unit not found.' indicate that systemd attempted to start a unit specified in the SYSTEMD_WANTS= directive but could not locate the corresponding unit file. This typically occurs when a device or service is configured to trigger the start of another unit that is either missing, renamed, or not installed. For example, in cases where the 'sys-fs-fuse-connections.mount' unit is not found, systemd logs a similar message. This behavior does not impact system reliability or availability, as systemd gracefully handles the absence of the specified unit by logging the message and continuing normal operations. To resolve this, identify the device or service with the SYSTEMD_WANTS= directive pointing to the missing unit and either install the required unit file or adjust the directive to reference an existing unit. This issue is benign and does not affect the functionality of Exadata/Exascale systems.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that the D-Bus daemon attempted to activate the 'dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service' unit via systemd but failed because the unit was not found. This suggests that the NetworkManager-dispatcher service is either not installed or its systemd unit file is missing. The NetworkManager-dispatcher service is responsible for executing scripts in response to network events, and its absence may prevent certain network-related scripts from running. However, this does not typically impact the core functionality of NetworkManager or the overall network connectivity. To resolve this issue, ensure that the NetworkManager-dispatcher service is installed and its systemd unit file is correctly configured. This behavior can be reproduced by attempting to start the NetworkManager-dispatcher service when it is not installed or its unit file is absent. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where missing or misconfigured systemd units lead to such activation failures. For example, in Arch Linux, users have encountered similar errors when the 'dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service' unit is not found, leading to repeated activation attempts by D-Bus.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate standard kernel messages during system initialization. The 'NMI watchdog: Perf event create on CPU 0 failed with -2' message suggests that the system's hardware performance monitoring unit (PMU) is either unavailable or unsupported, leading the kernel to disable the NMI watchdog on that CPU. This is a common occurrence on systems lacking a PMU and does not impact system stability. The 'acpi PNP0A03:00: _OSC failed (AE_NOT_FOUND); disabling ASPM' message indicates that the ACPI firmware does not support the _OSC method, resulting in the kernel disabling Active State Power Management (ASPM). This is typical on systems where the BIOS does not implement the _OSC method and does not affect system functionality. The 'acpi PNP0A03:00: fail to add MMCONFIG information, can't access extended PCI configuration space under this bridge.' message suggests that the system's ACPI tables do not provide MMCONFIG information, preventing access to extended PCI configuration space. This is often seen on systems with incomplete ACPI implementations and does not impact normal operation. The 'pci 0000:00:01.0: Activating ISA DMA hang workarounds' message indicates that the kernel is applying workarounds for potential ISA DMA hangs, which is a precautionary measure and not indicative of a problem.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd failed to activate the swap partition labeled 'SWAP' due to a dependency failure, resulting in a timeout while waiting for the device. This issue is commonly caused by an incorrect or outdated entry in the /etc/fstab file, where the system attempts to mount a non-existent or misconfigured swap partition. The impact on system reliability is minimal, as the absence of a swap partition may lead to reduced performance under memory pressure but does not prevent the system from operating. To reproduce this behavior, one can configure an invalid swap entry in /etc/fstab and observe the boot process. The recommended resolution is to verify the accuracy of the swap partition entry in /etc/fstab, ensuring that the device label or UUID matches the actual swap partition. If the swap partition is no longer needed, removing or commenting out the corresponding line in /etc/fstab will prevent systemd from attempting to activate it.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd failed to activate the swap partition labeled 'SWAP' due to a dependency failure, resulting in a timeout. This issue is commonly associated with misconfigurations in the /etc/fstab file, such as an incorrect or missing swap partition label or UUID. The impact on system reliability is minimal, as the absence of a swap partition may lead to reduced performance under heavy memory usage but does not affect system boot or core functionality. To reproduce this behavior, one can configure an invalid swap entry in /etc/fstab and observe the systemd startup sequence. Resolution involves verifying the swap partition's label or UUID using the 'blkid' command and ensuring that the /etc/fstab entry matches the correct identifier. Additionally, confirming that the swap partition is properly formatted with 'mkswap' and activated with 'swapon' can help mitigate the issue. Similar cases have been reported in various distributions, indicating that this is a common configuration oversight rather than a critical fault.

This failure leads to a cascade of service failures, including 'rc-oracle-exadata-zero.service' and 'dbserverd.service', both of which are critical for Exadata operations. The root cause is likely a missing or misconfigured swap partition, which can be reproduced by removing or renaming the swap partition.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that systemd encountered a timeout while attempting to start the device unit associated with the swap partition labeled 'SWAP'. This typically occurs when the swap partition is missing, has been renamed, or its label has changed, leading to a mismatch with the system's configuration. Such discrepancies can result from disk reformatting, partition table modifications, or manual changes to partition labels. The immediate impact is a delay during the boot process, as systemd waits for the device to become available before timing out. However, this does not affect the overall reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system, as the system can continue operating without an active swap partition, albeit with potential performance degradation under memory pressure. To resolve this issue, verify the current label of the swap partition using 'blkid' and update the '/etc/fstab' file accordingly to reflect the correct label or UUID. Alternatively, if the swap partition is no longer required, remove or comment out the corresponding entry in '/etc/fstab' to prevent systemd from attempting to mount it during boot. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and can be addressed through standard Linux system administration practices.

These messages are commonly observed during boot and typically do not impact system functionality. The 'NMI watchdog' message suggests that the system's performance monitoring unit (PMU) may not support certain performance events, leading to the watchdog's inability to create a performance event on CPU 0. This is often seen in systems without a hardware PMU or with limited PMU support, and the kernel may fall back to software events in such cases. The '_OSC failed (AE_NOT_FOUND); disabling ASPM' message indicates that the Operating System Capabilities (_OSC) method failed, possibly due to its absence in the firmware, resulting in the disabling of Active State Power Management (ASPM). This is a common occurrence and generally does not affect system performance. The 'fail to add MMCONFIG information' message suggests that the system cannot access extended PCI configuration space under a specific bridge, which may be due to firmware limitations or misconfigurations but typically does not impact system operation. Lastly, 'Activating ISA DMA hang workarounds' indicates that the kernel is applying workarounds for potential ISA Direct Memory Access (DMA) hangs, which is a precautionary measure and not indicative of an existing problem. Given that these messages are standard during boot and do not signify immediate issues, they can be considered benign. However, if there are observable performance issues or hardware malfunctions, further investigation into firmware updates or hardware diagnostics may be warranted.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that 'multipathd' is attempting to retrieve unique identifiers (UIDs) for devices 'xvda' and 'xvdd' but fails to do so. This behavior is typically observed when 'multipathd' scans all block devices, including those that are not configured for multipathing, such as local disks or virtual devices. These devices may not provide the necessary UID information, leading to the logged messages. This scenario is common and does not impact system reliability or availability. To suppress these messages, you can modify the '/etc/multipath.conf' file to blacklist non-multipathed devices by adding appropriate entries under the 'blacklist' section. For example, to ignore devices like 'xvda' and 'xvdd', you can add: 'blacklist { devnode ""^xvd[a-z]"" }'. After updating the configuration, restart the 'multipathd' service to apply the changes. This approach ensures that 'multipathd' ignores specified devices, preventing the generation of these benign messages.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that 'multipathd' is attempting to manage devices 'xvda', 'xvdd', 'xvdb', and 'xvdc', but fails to retrieve their unique identifiers (UIDs). These devices are typically associated with virtualized environments and are not intended for multipath management. The failure to obtain UIDs occurs because these devices do not provide the necessary attributes that 'multipathd' expects for multipath devices. This behavior does not impact system reliability or availability, as these devices are not part of any multipath configuration. To prevent 'multipathd' from attempting to manage these non-multipathed devices and to suppress the associated log messages, it is recommended to add a blacklist entry in the '/etc/multipath.conf' file. Specifically, adding 'devnode ""^xvd[a-z]*""' to the blacklist section will instruct 'multipathd' to ignore all 'xvd' devices. This configuration change ensures that 'multipathd' focuses only on devices that are intended for multipath management, thereby reducing unnecessary log noise. This issue is well-documented and considered benign in virtualized environments where 'xvd' devices are common.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that during the system shutdown process, the systemd-networkd.socket unit attempted to queue a startup job for systemd-networkd.service but failed due to a 'Transaction is destructive' error. This situation arises because systemd is in the process of stopping services as part of the shutdown sequence, and any attempt to start a service during this phase contradicts the ongoing transactions, leading to the observed error. This behavior is a known characteristic of systemd during shutdown and does not indicate a malfunction or misconfiguration. The impact on system reliability or availability is negligible, as the system is already transitioning to a powered-off state. This behavior can be reproduced by initiating a system shutdown while services are still attempting to start or handle new connections. No specific resolution is required, as this is expected behavior; however, ensuring that services are properly managed and not initiating new connections during shutdown can minimize such messages. Similar issues have been discussed in various forums, confirming that these messages are benign and can be safely ignored.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate several ACPI and PCI-related messages during system initialization. The 'NMI watchdog: Perf event create on CPU 0 failed with -2' message suggests that the Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) watchdog failed to create a performance event on CPU 0, potentially due to the absence of a Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) or unsupported hardware. This results in the NMI watchdog being disabled, which may limit certain diagnostic capabilities but does not impact system stability. The 'acpi PNP0A03:00: _OSC failed (AE_NOT_FOUND); disabling ASPM' message indicates that the Operating System Capabilities (_OSC) method failed, leading to the disabling of Active State Power Management (ASPM). This is often due to firmware limitations or missing ACPI methods and primarily affects power management efficiency without compromising system functionality. The 'acpi PNP0A03:00: fail to add MMCONFIG information, can't access extended PCI configuration space under this bridge.' message points to an inability to access extended PCI configuration space, likely due to firmware constraints, which may limit certain PCIe features but does not affect core system operations. Lastly, 'pci 0000:00:01.0: Activating ISA DMA hang workarounds' indicates that the system is applying workarounds for potential ISA Direct Memory Access (DMA) hangs, a precautionary measure that ensures system stability. Collectively, these messages are indicative of firmware or hardware limitations that may affect power management and diagnostic features but do not pose a critical risk to system reliability or availability. No immediate action is required, but updating system firmware or BIOS may address some of these messages.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is attempting to retrieve unique identifiers (UIDs) for devices 'xvdd' and 'xvda' but fails to do so. This typically occurs when multipathd scans all block devices, including those that are not configured for multipathing, such as local disks or virtual devices. These devices do not provide the necessary UID information required by multipathd, leading to the 'failed to get path uid' messages. This behavior is common in environments where multipathd is active but certain devices are not intended to be managed by it. The presence of these messages does not impact system reliability or availability. To suppress these benign messages, you can configure multipathd to ignore specific devices by adding them to the blacklist section in the /etc/multipath.conf file. For example, to blacklist devices starting with 'xvd', you can add: blacklist { devnode ""^xvd[a-z]"" }. After updating the configuration, restart the multipathd service to apply the changes. This approach ensures that multipathd does not attempt to manage non-multipathed devices, thereby preventing these informational messages from appearing in the logs.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'systemd-logind: Failed to abandon session scope: Transport endpoint is not connected' indicates a failure within the systemd-logind service, responsible for managing user logins and sessions. This error suggests that systemd-logind is unable to properly terminate a user session, potentially due to a stale or orphaned session scope. Such failures can lead to significant system issues, including prolonged SSH login times, inability to create new sessions, and overall system instability. Similar issues have been documented, where systemd-logind fails after handling a large number of SSH connections, resulting in delays and requiring service restarts. To reproduce this issue, one might simulate numerous SSH logins and logouts, observing the system's behavior over time. Resolution steps include restarting the systemd-logind service to clear stale sessions and considering an update to a more recent systemd version, as upstream fixes have addressed related session management bugs. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The failure of the exadata-netdiag-dump.service indicates a malfunction in the Exadata network diagnostics data collection process. This service is essential for gathering network diagnostic information, which is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting network-related issues within the Exadata environment. The failure could be due to a corrupted or missing service file, misconfiguration, or underlying system issues affecting service dependencies. This malfunction may impede the ability to perform effective network diagnostics, potentially leading to undetected network problems that can affect system performance and reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could attempt to start the exadata-netdiag-dump.service manually and observe the failure messages for more detailed error information. Resolution steps include checking the status of the service using 'systemctl status exadata-netdiag-dump.service', reviewing related logs in '/var/log/messages' for error details, and verifying the integrity and configuration of the service files.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate several ACPI-related messages during system initialization. The 'NMI watchdog: Perf event create on CPU 0 failed with -2' message suggests that the Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI) watchdog failed to create a performance event on CPU 0, potentially due to the absence of a Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU) or unsupported hardware. This results in the NMI watchdog being disabled, which may affect the system's ability to detect certain types of hangs but does not impact normal operation. The 'acpi PNP0A03:00: _OSC failed (AE_NOT_FOUND); disabling ASPM' message indicates that the Operating System Capabilities (_OSC) method failed, leading to the disabling of Active State Power Management (ASPM). This is often due to firmware limitations or missing ACPI methods and primarily affects power management efficiency without compromising system stability. The 'acpi PNP0A03:00: fail to add MMCONFIG information, can't access extended PCI configuration space under this bridge.' message suggests that the system cannot access extended PCI configuration space, likely due to firmware constraints, which may limit certain PCIe functionalities but typically does not affect overall system performance. Lastly, 'pci 0000:00:01.0: Activating ISA DMA hang workarounds' indicates that the system is applying workarounds for potential ISA Direct Memory Access (DMA) hangs, a precautionary measure that does not signify an active issue. These messages are common in various Linux distributions and are generally considered benign, with no immediate action required. However, if there are observable performance issues or hardware malfunctions, reviewing firmware updates or BIOS settings related to ACPI and PCIe configurations is advisable.

This typically occurs when multipathd scans all block devices, including those not configured for multipathing, such as local or virtual disks. These devices do not provide the necessary UID information, leading to the observed messages. This behavior is common in environments where multipathd is active but certain devices are not intended to be managed by it. The messages are benign and do not impact system functionality. To suppress these messages, you can modify the /etc/multipath.conf file to blacklist non-multipathed devices by adding appropriate entries under the 'blacklist' section.
