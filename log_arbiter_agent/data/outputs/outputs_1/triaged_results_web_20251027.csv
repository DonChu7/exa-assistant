Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry indicates that the Name Service Cache Daemon (nscd) is unable to access the /etc/resolv.conf file, resulting in the error 'stat failed for file `/etc/resolv.conf'; will try again later: No such file or directory'. This file is essential for DNS resolution, and its absence can lead to significant network communication issues, affecting the reliability and availability of Exadata/Exascale systems. The root cause is the missing or misconfigured /etc/resolv.conf file, which may occur due to manual deletion, misconfiguration, or issues with services that manage this file, such as systemd-resolved. To reproduce this issue, one can remove or rename the /etc/resolv.conf file and restart nscd. To resolve this, ensure that /etc/resolv.conf exists and contains valid DNS server entries. If systemd-resolved is in use, verify that it is correctly configured and running. Additionally, confirm that nscd is properly monitoring /etc/resolv.conf for changes. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The failure of the uptrack-prefetch.service indicates that the Ksplice Uptrack client is unable to prefetch updates, often due to the running kernel version not being supported by Ksplice. This situation is common when the kernel has been recently updated and Ksplice updates for that version are not yet available. The impact on system reliability is minimal, as Ksplice updates are supplementary and do not affect the core functionality of the system. To resolve this issue, you can disable the uptrack-prefetch.service by running 'systemctl disable uptrack-prefetch.service' if Ksplice is not in use. Alternatively, ensure that the Ksplice client is up to date and compatible with your current kernel version. This behavior is documented in Oracle's forums, where users have reported similar issues and resolutions.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The 'exadata-netdiag-dump.service' failure due to a timeout indicates a malfunction in the network diagnostics data collection process on the Exadata system. This service is essential for gathering network diagnostic information, which is crucial for monitoring and troubleshooting network-related issues. A timeout failure suggests that the service is unable to complete its operations within the expected timeframe, potentially due to underlying network problems, resource constraints, or misconfigurations. This failure can impede the system's ability to detect and respond to network anomalies, thereby affecting the overall reliability and performance of the Exadata environment. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate network congestion or introduce delays in network diagnostics processes to observe if the service times out. Resolution steps include reviewing system logs for detailed error messages, verifying network configurations, ensuring adequate system resources are available, and consulting Oracle support for known issues or patches related to this service. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The 'selinux-autorelabel.service' is designed to relabel the filesystem's SELinux contexts during boot when the '/.autorelabel' file is present. Its failure with result 'signal' indicates an unexpected termination, possibly due to a segmentation fault or similar issue. This service is typically a one-time operation during system initialization and is not essential for ongoing system functionality. Therefore, its failure does not impact the reliability or availability of Exadata/Exascale systems. To reproduce this behavior, one could create the '/.autorelabel' file and observe the service's behavior during the next boot. If the service fails, it may be due to a corrupted SELinux policy or filesystem inconsistencies. Resolution steps include verifying the integrity of the SELinux policy, checking for filesystem errors, and ensuring that the system is up to date with the latest patches. Similar issues have been observed in other services where unexpected terminations occurred, often due to underlying system misconfigurations or software bugs. However, in this context, the failure of 'selinux-autorelabel.service' is non-impacting and can be safely ignored.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The error message 'selinux-autorelabel: Failed to connect to bus: No such file or directory' indicates that during the SELinux autorelabeling process, the 'selinux-autorelabel' utility attempted to communicate with the D-Bus system message bus but failed due to its unavailability. This situation is typical during system initialization phases, especially when the D-Bus service has not yet started or is intentionally disabled. The 'selinux-autorelabel' process is designed to function independently of D-Bus, and its primary task of relabeling the filesystem is not hindered by this error. Consequently, this message can be considered benign and does not impact the reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. No specific action is required to address this log entry.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple paths failing in the device-mapper multipath subsystem, with 'alua: rtpg failed, result 65536' errors. This suggests issues with the ALUA (Asymmetric Logical Unit Access) path management, potentially due to storage controller misconfigurations, firmware bugs, or connectivity problems. Such failures can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to storage devices, severely impacting Exadata/Exascale system reliability. Reproduction may occur during storage controller firmware upgrades or misconfigurations, as noted in Red Hat Bugzilla reports. Immediate investigation is required to identify and resolve the root cause, which may involve verifying storage controller configurations, updating firmware, or checking physical connections. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon is failing to retrieve udev device information for multiple block devices, as evidenced by repeated 'get_udev_device: failed to look up' messages. This issue suggests a malfunction in the udev subsystem or a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, potentially leading to improper device mapping and degraded I/O performance. Such failures can be reproduced by introducing inconsistencies in the udev rules or by modifying multipath configurations without proper validation. To resolve this, verify the integrity of udev rules and ensure that the multipath configuration aligns with the system's hardware setup. Additionally, consult the Red Hat Customer Portal for guidance on similar issues, such as the one documented in solution 6026351. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) has marked multiple device paths (sdo, sdf, sdd, etc.) as failed. This suggests a significant issue with the storage subsystem, potentially due to hardware failures, misconfigurations, or connectivity problems. Such widespread path failures can severely impact the reliability and availability of the Exadata/Exascale system, as multipath I/O is essential for redundancy and load balancing. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Immediate investigation is required to identify the root cause, which may involve checking hardware components, verifying multipath configurations, and examining network connectivity. Similar issues have been documented where multipath devices are marked as read-only or fail due to underlying storage problems. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The 'grub-boot-success.service' failure indicates an issue with marking the boot process as successful, typically due to a missing or corrupted '/boot/grub2/grubenv' file. This file is essential for GRUB to track boot success and manage boot entries. The absence or corruption of 'grubenv' can lead to repeated failures of the 'grub-boot-success.service', as observed in the logs. However, this does not impact the system's ability to boot or operate normally. To resolve this, recreate the 'grubenv' file using the command 'sudo grub2-editenv create', which will generate a new environment block for GRUB. This approach has been effective in similar cases, as documented in Fedora discussions. Additionally, ensure that the 'grubenv' file is at least 1024 bytes in size, as smaller sizes can cause errors with GRUB utilities. This issue is recognized in Red Hat Bugzilla 1702354, where it was noted that 'grub2-set-bootflag' fails if 'grubenv' is not at least 1024 bytes long. Therefore, while the error messages are indicative of a configuration issue, they do not signify a critical fault affecting system reliability.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that during the dracut process, the microcode_ctl utility failed to perform an early microcode update for Intel processors with identifiers 'intel-06-4e-03' and 'intel-06-8e-9e-0x-0xca' on kernel version '5.15.0-313.189.5.el8uek.x86_64', resulting in the message 'failed early load check... skipping'. This behavior is typically due to compatibility issues between specific microcode versions and certain kernel versions, leading to the exclusion of the microcode from the initramfs during boot-time updates. Such exclusions are often intentional to prevent potential system instability associated with early microcode loading on affected processor models. For instance, similar issues have been documented with Intel microcode updates causing system hangs during early boot, leading to the decision to skip these updates to maintain system stability. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is minimal, as the system can still perform late microcode updates after the kernel has initialized, ensuring that critical microcode patches are applied without compromising system stability. To reproduce this behavior, one would need to attempt an early microcode update on a system with the specified Intel processors and kernel version, observing the failure during the dracut process. No immediate action is required, but it is advisable to ensure that the system's BIOS is up to date, as BIOS updates can also provide necessary microcode patches. Additionally, monitoring for updates to the microcode_ctl package that address these compatibility issues is recommended. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and does not require further development review.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The 'exawatcher.service' failure due to a timeout indicates that the ExaWatcher monitoring service did not start within the expected timeframe. ExaWatcher is integral to monitoring and maintaining the health of Exadata systems; its failure can lead to unmonitored system states, potentially missing critical alerts or performance issues. This behavior can be reproduced by attempting to start the service and observing the timeout. To resolve this, verify the service's configuration, ensure all dependencies are met, and consider increasing the 'TimeoutStartSec' parameter in the service's systemd unit file to allow more time for startup. Additionally, inspect system logs for underlying issues causing the delay. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the rpc.statd service is failing to start due to an inability to access the local netconfig database, resulting in the error 'Netconfig database not found' and subsequent failure to create RPC listeners. This issue is critical as it prevents the rpc.statd service from functioning, which is essential for NFSv2/3 locking mechanisms. The root cause is likely a missing or corrupted netconfig database, which is crucial for network configuration information. This problem can be reproduced by removing or corrupting the netconfig database file, typically located at /etc/netconfig. To resolve this issue, verify the existence and integrity of the /etc/netconfig file. If it is missing or corrupted, restore it from a backup or reinstall the relevant package that provides this file. Additionally, ensure that the rpcbind service is running, as rpc.statd depends on it for RPC listener creation.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry indicates that the 'rc-oracle-exadata-zero.service' failed with result 'signal', suggesting an unexpected termination due to a signal, possibly a segmentation fault or similar critical error. This service is integral to Exadata systems, and its failure can lead to significant disruptions in system operations. Similar issues have been documented, such as the CELLSRV process encountering fatal signals leading to service restarts, as noted in Exadata Critical Issue DB20. To reproduce this issue, one might simulate conditions that trigger signal-based terminations in systemd services, though this is not recommended in a production environment. Immediate investigation is required to determine the root cause, which may involve analyzing core dumps, reviewing recent system changes, and consulting Oracle support for known bugs or patches.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The 'chrony-wait.service' failure due to a timeout indicates that the system clock synchronization did not complete within the expected timeframe. This service is designed to delay system startup until the 'chronyd' daemon has synchronized the system clock with NTP servers. A timeout can occur if 'chronyd' is unable to reach its configured NTP servers, possibly due to network issues, misconfigured NTP server addresses, or firewall restrictions. While this failure may delay system boot, it does not directly impact the overall reliability or availability of Exadata/Exascale systems, as the system can still operate with an unsynchronized clock. To address this issue, verify the network connectivity to the NTP servers, ensure the NTP server addresses in the 'chrony.conf' file are correct, and check for any firewall rules that might be blocking NTP traffic. Additionally, consider increasing the timeout value for 'chrony-wait.service' to accommodate longer synchronization times in environments with network latency. This behavior can be reproduced by configuring 'chronyd' with unreachable NTP servers and observing the resulting timeout in 'chrony-wait.service'.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that systemd failed to activate the swap device labeled 'SWAP', resulting in an 'exit-code' failure. This typically occurs when the swap device is missing, misconfigured, or its label has changed. Such issues are common in various Linux distributions and are generally non-critical, as they do not impact the core functionality of the system. To resolve this, verify the existence and correct labeling of the swap device, and ensure that the /etc/fstab file references the correct device. If the swap device is no longer needed, consider removing or commenting out its entry in /etc/fstab to prevent systemd from attempting to activate it during boot. Similar issues have been reported in other contexts, such as the failure to activate swap on /ephemeral0.2 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where the swap device was missing, leading to a failed activation attempt.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'XFS (dm-10): last sector read failed' indicates a read failure on the last sector of the XFS filesystem located on the device mapped to dm-10. This error suggests potential hardware issues, such as bad sectors on the underlying storage device, or filesystem corruption. Such failures can lead to data loss or filesystem unavailability, impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one might simulate disk errors or corrupt the filesystem's last sector. Immediate steps include checking hardware health using tools like SMART diagnostics, and running 'xfs_repair' to attempt filesystem recovery. If hardware faults are confirmed, replacing the affected storage device is recommended. Similar issues have been documented, emphasizing the need for prompt intervention to prevent data loss.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The error message 'swapoff: /dev/disk/by-label/SWAP: swapoff failed: Invalid argument' typically indicates that the specified swap device is not currently active or recognized as a valid swap area. This can occur if the swap partition or file has been removed, is corrupted, or was never properly initialized. In the context of Exadata/Exascale systems, this message is generally benign and does not impact system reliability or availability. To address this, verify the existence and integrity of the swap device at '/dev/disk/by-label/SWAP'. If the device is missing or corrupted, recreate the swap partition or file, format it with 'mkswap', and activate it using 'swapon'. Additionally, ensure that the '/etc/fstab' file correctly references the swap device to enable automatic mounting at boot.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'kernel: nvme nvme1: Failed to configure AEN (cfg 200)' indicates that the NVMe controller encountered an issue while setting up Asynchronous Event Notifications (AENs). This message is typically associated with the controller's inability to configure AENs due to unsupported features or transient conditions during initialization. In the context of Exadata/Exascale systems, such a failure does not directly impact the core functionality or reliability of the storage subsystem, as AENs are primarily used for optional event reporting. Similar occurrences have been documented in various environments without leading to critical failures. Therefore, this message can be considered benign and does not necessitate immediate action.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that the 'systemd-vconsole-setup' service encountered errors related to the 'KD_FONT_OP_GET' operation, resulting in messages stating 'Invalid argument' and 'Fonts will not be copied to remaining consoles.' This issue typically arises when the framebuffer console driver ('fbcon') employs deferred takeover, causing 'systemd-vconsole-setup' to attempt font settings on consoles that do not support such operations at that moment. The impact is limited to the virtual console's font settings and does not affect the overall reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. To mitigate this, adding the 'fbcon=nodefer' kernel command line option can prevent the deferred takeover behavior, thereby allowing 'systemd-vconsole-setup' to function correctly during boot. This adjustment can be made by executing 'sudo grubby --update-kernel=DEFAULT --args=""fbcon=nodefer""' on systems where 'grubby' is available. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and is considered benign.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'systemd: Failed unmounting /tmp.' indicates that during the shutdown process, systemd encountered an issue unmounting the /tmp directory. This is typically due to active processes or open files within /tmp at the time of shutdown, preventing its unmounting. Common culprits include services like Xorg or other applications that may not terminate cleanly. While this failure can lead to a delay in the shutdown process, it does not usually impact the overall reliability or availability of the system. To mitigate this issue, ensure that all services and applications are properly stopped before shutdown. Additionally, reviewing the system logs to identify which processes are keeping /tmp busy can help in addressing the root cause. This behavior has been observed in various Linux distributions and is generally considered a benign issue that does not require immediate action.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple systemd dependency failures related to essential filesystems and swap partitions, including /var/log/audit, /crashfiles, /tmp, and swap. These failures are due to timeouts when attempting to start devices identified by specific labels (AUDIT, KDUMP, SWAP, TMP), suggesting that the system is unable to locate or access these devices during boot. This issue can lead to significant system instability, as critical services and logging mechanisms may not function correctly. The root cause is likely misconfigured or missing entries in the /etc/fstab file, where the system expects these devices to be present. To resolve this, verify the existence and correctness of the device entries in /etc/fstab, ensuring that all specified devices are available and correctly labeled. If any devices are missing or mislabeled, update /etc/fstab accordingly or remove the entries if the devices are no longer in use. Additionally, check for any hardware issues or changes that might have affected device availability. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux forums, where incorrect fstab configurations led to systemd dependency failures during boot. For example, a discussion on the Arch Linux Forums highlights how incorrect fstab entries can cause such failures. [https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?id=153258] This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The systemd logs indicate a failure to activate the swap partition labeled 'SWAP' due to a missing or misconfigured device. This issue is commonly caused by discrepancies between the swap partition's current configuration and the entries in /etc/fstab or the kernel's resume parameters. Such mismatches can occur after disk partitioning changes, such as resizing or recreating the swap partition, leading to systemd's inability to locate the specified device during boot. The primary impact is a delay during startup, typically around 90 seconds, as systemd waits for the device to become available before timing out. However, this does not affect the overall reliability or availability of the Exadata/Exascale system, as the system can continue operating without an active swap partition, albeit with potential performance degradation under memory pressure. To resolve this issue, verify the current UUID or label of the swap partition using the blkid command and update /etc/fstab accordingly. Additionally, ensure that the kernel's resume parameters in the bootloader configuration are consistent with the current swap partition settings. If hibernation is not utilized, consider removing the resume parameter to prevent systemd from attempting to resume from a non-existent device. This approach has been effective in similar scenarios, as documented in various user reports and forums.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'rngd: [hwrng ]: Initialization Failed' indicates that the rngd daemon failed to initialize the hardware random number generator (hwrng) entropy source. This failure is typically non-impacting, as rngd is designed to utilize multiple entropy sources and can operate effectively as long as at least one source is successfully initialized. Common alternative sources include the RDRAND instruction on Intel processors and the JITTER entropy source. The failure to initialize hwrng may result from the absence of a hardware RNG device, lack of necessary kernel modules, or insufficient permissions to access /dev/hwrng. To address this, ensure that the hardware RNG device is present and functional, verify that the appropriate kernel modules are loaded, and confirm that rngd has the necessary permissions to access /dev/hwrng. Additionally, reviewing the systemd service configuration for rngd may help identify any constraints affecting device access. Given that rngd can function with other entropy sources, this specific initialization failure does not pose a critical issue to system reliability or availability.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'kernel: sd 0:0:0:4: [sdc] Synchronize Cache(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE' indicates a failure during the SCSI 'Synchronize Cache' command for device sdc. This command is crucial for ensuring that all buffered data is written to the disk, and its failure suggests potential issues with the storage device or its connection. The 'hostbyte=DID_OK' indicates that the host controller did not detect an error, while 'driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE' signifies that the driver received a sense code from the device, pointing to a hardware error. Such failures can lead to data loss or corruption, especially if write operations were pending. Similar issues have been reported in various contexts, often associated with failing storage devices or unstable connections. For instance, a discussion on the Manjaro Linux Forum highlights a user experiencing similar errors with a USB backup disk, leading to recommendations for immediate data backup and device replacement. To reproduce this issue, one might simulate a failing disk or an unstable connection during write operations. Immediate steps should include backing up all critical data from the affected device, checking physical connections, and considering hardware diagnostics or replacement. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple paths failing in the device-mapper multipath subsystem, with messages such as 'device-mapper: multipath: Failing path 8:112.' This suggests that the system is experiencing path failures, which can lead to reduced redundancy and potential I/O errors. Such issues can arise from hardware malfunctions, misconfigurations, or transient connectivity problems. In Exadata environments, where high availability and performance are paramount, these path failures can significantly impact system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting specific storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Resolution steps include verifying the physical connections, checking for hardware faults, and reviewing the multipath configuration for correctness. Additionally, consulting the Red Hat Bugzilla report on similar multipath failure messages (https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2018531) may provide further insights.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that systemd-logind failed to start a new session scope due to a conflicting stop job queued for the user slice. This situation typically arises when a user logs out, and systemd initiates a stop job to clean up the user slice. If a new login attempt occurs before this cleanup completes, systemd may reject the start job for the new session scope, resulting in the observed error message. This behavior is a known characteristic of systemd versions prior to v228, where the job mode used by manager_start_unit was 'fail', leading to such conflicts. Upgrading to a newer systemd version (v228 or later) resolves this issue by changing the job mode to 'replace', allowing the start job to override the pending stop job. Alternatively, enabling user lingering with 'loginctl enable-linger' for the affected user can prevent the user slice from being stopped upon logout, mitigating the conflict. This incident does not impact Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability and can be considered benign.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) has marked multiple paths (e.g., sdh, sdi, sdk) as failed, suggesting a significant disruption in the storage subsystem. This behavior can result from various issues, including hardware failures, misconfigurations, or network problems affecting the storage paths. The immediate impact is a reduction in available paths for I/O operations, which can degrade performance and, if redundancy is compromised, lead to potential data unavailability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage links or disabling relevant interfaces. Resolution steps include verifying the physical and logical connectivity of the affected paths, checking for hardware faults, and reviewing multipath configurations for correctness.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting multiple path failures with messages such as 'sync_map_state: failing sdh state 2 dmstate 2'. In the context of Exadata systems, multipathd is responsible for managing multiple I/O paths to storage devices, ensuring redundancy and high availability. The repeated failure messages suggest that multiple storage paths are experiencing issues simultaneously, which can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to the affected storage devices. This behavior can be reproduced by simulating path failures in a multipath configuration, leading to similar log entries. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to investigate the underlying causes of the path failures, such as hardware faults, misconfigurations, or connectivity issues, and address them promptly to restore normal operation. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'kernel: sd 6:0:0:4: [sda] Synchronize Cache(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE' indicates a failure during the SCSI 'Synchronize Cache' command for device sda. This command is essential for ensuring that all buffered data is written to the disk, and its failure suggests potential issues with the storage device or its connection. The 'hostbyte=DID_OK' indicates that the host controller did not detect an error, while 'driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE' signifies that the driver has additional sense data, typically pointing to hardware errors. Such failures can lead to data loss or corruption, especially if write operations are pending. This behavior can be reproduced by attempting to flush the cache on a failing or improperly connected disk. Immediate steps should include checking the physical connections, reviewing system logs for related errors, and performing a SMART diagnostic on the disk to assess its health. If the issue persists, replacing the disk or its controller may be necessary. Similar issues have been reported in various forums, indicating that this is a known problem with significant implications for system reliability. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that systemd-logind failed to start a new session scope due to a conflicting stop job queued for the user slice. This situation typically arises when a user logs out, and systemd initiates a stop job for the user slice. If the same user attempts to log in again before the stop job completes, systemd-logind encounters a conflict, resulting in the 'Transaction is destructive' error. This behavior is a known characteristic of systemd versions prior to v228, where the job mode used by manager_start_unit was 'fail', leading to such conflicts. Upgrading to systemd v228 or later resolves this issue by changing the job mode to 'replace', allowing the start job to override the pending stop job, thereby preventing the conflict. Alternatively, enabling user lingering with 'loginctl enable-linger' for the affected user can prevent the user slice from being stopped upon logout, mitigating the issue. This incident does not impact Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability and can be considered benign.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting multiple path failures across various devices (e.g., sdh, sdk, sdq, etc.), with both the path state and device-mapper state set to 2. This state typically signifies that the paths are down or have failed. Such widespread path failures can severely impact the reliability and availability of the storage subsystem, potentially leading to I/O errors, degraded performance, or complete data inaccessibility. The root cause may stem from hardware issues (e.g., faulty HBAs, cables, or storage controllers), misconfigurations in the multipath setup, or firmware bugs. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Immediate steps should include verifying the physical connections, checking the health of storage hardware components, reviewing multipath configurations for correctness, and examining system logs for related errors. Additionally, consulting vendor documentation and support channels is advisable to identify any known issues or firmware updates that address similar problems. Given the critical nature of this incident, prompt action is required to restore storage path redundancy and ensure data integrity.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that systemd-logind failed to start a new session scope because a system shutdown was already in progress. This occurs when a user attempts to initiate a new session while the system is executing a poweroff sequence, leading to a conflict in systemd's job queue. This behavior is expected during shutdown procedures and does not impact system reliability. The issue can be reproduced by attempting to start a new session during an active shutdown process. No specific resolution is required, as this is standard systemd behavior. Similar occurrences have been documented in various Linux distributions, confirming that this is a benign event. For instance, Red Hat's knowledge base notes that such messages can be safely ignored during shutdown sequences.

This error is commonly associated with dependencies between resources, where stopping one resource requires stopping or relocating dependent resources. For example, attempting to stop a database instance without specifying the force option can fail if there are dependent services running. To resolve this issue, ensure that all dependent resources are properly managed during stop operations, and consider using the force option when necessary.

This suggests a significant issue with the storage subsystem, potentially due to path failures, misconfigurations, or hardware faults. Such failures can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to storage devices, severely impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing configuration errors in the multipath setup. Immediate investigation is required to identify the root cause, which may involve checking hardware connections, reviewing multipath configurations, and analyzing system logs for related errors.

This suggests a significant issue in the storage connectivity or configuration, potentially leading to reduced redundancy and performance degradation. Such failures can be caused by hardware issues (e.g., faulty cables, HBA failures), misconfigurations in multipath settings, or compatibility problems with specific storage arrays. For instance, certain versions of device-mapper-multipath have been known to cause path failures with specific storage systems, as documented in Red Hat's knowledge base. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing configuration errors. Immediate investigation is recommended to identify the root cause, which may involve checking hardware connections, reviewing multipath configurations, and ensuring compatibility between the multipath tools and the storage hardware.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting multiple path failures across various devices (e.g., sdh, sdk, sdn, etc.), with both the path state and device-mapper state set to 2. This state typically signifies that the paths are down or have encountered errors. Such widespread path failures can severely impact the reliability and availability of storage subsystems in Exadata/Exascale environments, potentially leading to I/O errors, degraded performance, or complete service outages. The root cause may stem from hardware issues (e.g., faulty HBAs, cables, or storage controllers), misconfigurations in the multipath setup, or known bugs in the multipathd service. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Immediate steps should include verifying the physical connections, reviewing multipath configurations, and checking for firmware or driver updates. Additionally, consulting Red Hat Bugzilla reports, such as Bug 1698970, which discusses multipathd unresponsiveness after storage faults, may provide further insights. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'kernel: sd 0:0:0:4: [sdb] Synchronize Cache(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE' indicates a failure during the SCSI 'Synchronize Cache' command for device sdb. This command is essential for ensuring that all buffered data is written to the disk, and its failure suggests potential issues with the storage device or its connection. The 'hostbyte=DID_OK' indicates that the host controller did not detect an error, while 'driverbyte=DRIVER_SENSE' signifies that the driver received a sense code from the device, pointing to a hardware error. Such failures can lead to data loss or corruption, especially if write operations are pending. Similar issues have been reported in various contexts, often associated with failing storage devices or unstable connections. To reproduce this issue, one might simulate a failing disk or introduce connection instability. Immediate steps should include checking the physical connections, reviewing system logs for related errors, and considering hardware diagnostics on the storage device. If the device is part of an Exadata/Exascale system, this incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This widespread path failure suggests a significant disruption in the storage subsystem, potentially due to issues such as SCSI reservation conflicts, hardware malfunctions, or misconfigurations in the multipath setup. Such failures can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to the affected storage devices, severely impacting system reliability and availability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing SCSI reservation conflicts. Immediate investigation is required to identify the root cause, which may involve checking for SCSI reservation conflicts, verifying hardware integrity, and reviewing multipath configurations. Resolution steps include clearing any SCSI reservations, replacing faulty hardware components, and ensuring the multipath configuration is correctly set up. Similar issues have been documented where SCSI reservations caused multipath to fail, even when underlying storage devices were operational.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that systemd is failing to mount several essential filesystems (/tmp, /var/log/audit, /crashfiles) and activate swap due to timeouts when waiting for devices labeled TMP, SWAP, AUDIT, and KDUMP. This suggests that the system is unable to detect or access these devices during boot, leading to dependency failures and potentially preventing the system from operating correctly. Such issues can arise from hardware failures, misconfigured or missing entries in /etc/fstab, or changes in device identifiers (UUIDs or labels) that are not reflected in system configurations. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate a missing or mislabeled device referenced in /etc/fstab. Resolution steps include verifying the existence and correct labeling of the devices, ensuring /etc/fstab entries match current device identifiers, and checking for hardware connectivity issues. Similar cases have been reported where systemd times out waiting for devices due to incorrect fstab entries or device identifier changes. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This behavior is documented in Red Hat's knowledge base, confirming that these errors are expected during shutdown and do not require intervention.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is encountering repeated failures in synchronizing the state of multiple paths (sdh, sdk, sdn, sdq, sdt), all reporting 'state 2 dmstate 2'. In the context of multipathd, 'state 2' corresponds to a 'faulty' path status, and 'dmstate 2' indicates that the device-mapper also recognizes the path as failed. This pattern suggests a persistent issue where paths are being marked as faulty and are not being reinstated properly. A similar issue has been documented in a patch discussion where reinstated paths were immediately being failed again due to a race condition in the multipathd daemon. This behavior can lead to I/O disruptions and degraded performance, especially in environments relying on multipath configurations for redundancy and load balancing. To reproduce this issue, one could manually fail and reinstate paths in a high-load environment, observing if the paths are consistently marked as faulty upon reinstatement. Resolution steps include applying patches that address this specific race condition in multipathd, as discussed in the referenced patch notes. Additionally, reviewing and updating the multipath configuration to ensure it aligns with best practices for path management and failover is recommended. Given the critical nature of this issue, it is imperative to address it promptly to maintain system reliability and performance.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple systemd dependency failures during startup, specifically for mount points such as /crashfiles, /var/log/audit, /tmp, and the swap partition, all resulting from device timeout errors. These failures suggest that the system is unable to access or mount essential filesystems and swap space, which can severely impact system stability and functionality. The root cause is likely due to missing or inaccessible devices labeled KDUMP, AUDIT, TMP, and SWAP, possibly caused by hardware issues, misconfigured fstab entries, or missing storage devices. This behavior can be reproduced by removing or renaming the devices corresponding to these labels or by introducing errors in the fstab configuration. To resolve this issue, verify the existence and accessibility of the devices with the specified labels, ensure that the fstab entries are correctly configured, and check for any hardware failures or disconnections. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where incorrect fstab configurations or missing devices lead to systemd dependency failures during boot. For example, in Arch Linux, users have encountered 'Dependency failed for' errors due to misconfigured fstab entries, leading to systemd failing to mount specified filesystems.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the iscsi.service has failed to start due to exceeding the systemd start limit, resulting in a 'start-limit-hit' error. This suggests that the service has attempted to restart multiple times within a short period, each time failing, which has triggered systemd's rate-limiting mechanism. The iSCSI service is crucial for managing iSCSI devices, and its failure can lead to the unavailability of storage resources, potentially causing significant disruptions in data access and system operations. This issue can be reproduced by configuring the iscsi.service with aggressive restart settings and inducing repeated failures, leading to the start limit being hit. To resolve this, it's essential to identify and address the root cause of the service failures, which could range from misconfigurations, network issues, to hardware problems. Additionally, adjusting the StartLimitIntervalSec and StartLimitBurst parameters in the service configuration can help manage the restart behavior. Given the critical nature of this service in Exadata/Exascale environments, immediate attention is required to restore functionality and prevent potential data access issues.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple systemd dependency failures during boot, specifically for swap partitions and critical mount points such as /var/log/audit, /crashfiles, and /tmp. These failures are due to systemd's inability to locate devices labeled SWAP, AUDIT, KDUMP, and TMP, resulting in timeout errors. This scenario suggests that the system is attempting to mount or activate devices that are either missing, misconfigured, or have incorrect labels. Such issues can lead to significant system instability, including the inability to perform essential logging, crash dumping, and temporary file storage, all of which are vital for system operations and diagnostics. To reproduce this issue, one could configure /etc/fstab or systemd unit files to reference non-existent or incorrectly labeled devices, leading to similar dependency failures during boot. Resolution steps include verifying the existence and correct labeling of the devices in question, ensuring that /etc/fstab and relevant systemd unit files accurately reference these devices, and correcting any discrepancies.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry indicates that the SSH daemon (sshd) on host scaqan16adm05.us.oracle.com failed to bind to port 22 on IP address 10.32.99.214, resulting in the error 'Cannot assign requested address.' This error typically occurs when the specified IP address is not available on any network interface of the host, possibly due to misconfiguration, network interface issues, or the IP address being unassigned. As a result, the SSH service may not be accessible on the intended IP address, potentially impacting remote management and access to the system. To reproduce this issue, configure sshd to listen on an IP address that is not assigned to any active network interface and attempt to start the service. Resolution involves verifying that 10.32.99.214 is correctly assigned to an active network interface on the host and ensuring that the sshd configuration specifies valid and available IP addresses.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that the D-Bus system daemon attempted to activate the 'dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service' unit but failed because the unit was not found. This suggests that the NetworkManager-dispatcher service is either not installed or not enabled on the system. The NetworkManager-dispatcher is responsible for executing scripts in response to network events, but its absence does not impede the core functionality of NetworkManager or the system's networking capabilities. This behavior can occur if the NetworkManager-dispatcher package is not installed or if the service is disabled. To resolve these messages, you can install the NetworkManager-dispatcher package and enable the service, or if the dispatcher functionality is not required, you can safely ignore these messages. Similar issues have been discussed in various forums, indicating that this is a common and non-impacting occurrence.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the systemd service responsible for activating the swap partition failed due to a timeout while waiting for the device /dev/disk/by-label/SWAP. This failure led to the kdump service being unable to start, as it depends on the availability of swap space for crash recovery operations. The root cause is likely a misconfiguration in the /etc/fstab file, where the swap partition is referenced by label, but the system cannot locate the device with the specified label during boot. This issue can be reproduced by configuring a swap partition with a label that does not exist or is incorrectly specified in /etc/fstab. To resolve this, verify the existence and correctness of the swap partition label using the 'blkid' command, and ensure that the /etc/fstab entry for the swap partition matches this label. Alternatively, referencing the swap partition by its UUID or device path in /etc/fstab can prevent such issues. Additionally, after correcting the fstab entry, regenerate the initramfs to ensure the changes are applied during boot. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'multipathd: sda: pathinfo failed after change uevent' indicates that the multipath daemon encountered an issue retrieving path information for device 'sda' following a udev change event. This can occur if 'sda' is a local disk not managed by multipath, leading to benign errors when multipathd attempts to process it. To prevent such messages, consider adding 'sda' to the 'blacklist' section in the multipath configuration file, ensuring multipathd ignores this device. This behavior is common in systems where multipathd monitors all block devices, including those not intended for multipath management, and does not impact system reliability or availability.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that 'multipathd' is failing to retrieve path information for devices sda, sdc, sdd, and sde following change uevents. This suggests potential issues with device identification or udev event processing, which can lead to improper path management and compromise the reliability of the multipath configuration. Such failures may result from misconfigurations in the multipath configuration file, particularly in the 'getuid_callout' directive, or from udev processing errors. To reproduce this issue, one could introduce errors in the 'getuid_callout' configuration or simulate udev processing delays. Resolution steps include verifying and correcting the 'getuid_callout' configuration to ensure it accurately retrieves device identifiers, and ensuring that udev rules are correctly configured and functioning as expected. Additionally, reviewing system logs for udev-related errors and ensuring that all devices are properly recognized and configured can help mitigate this issue. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

The 'hostbyte=DID_OK' and 'driverbyte=DRIVER_OK' suggest that the command was issued and processed without transport errors, yet the operation did not complete successfully. This pattern is commonly observed when a device is unexpectedly disconnected or powered off before the cache synchronization completes. In such scenarios, the system logs this message to indicate the inability to flush the device's cache, which could potentially lead to data loss if write operations were pending. However, if the device was intentionally removed or powered down after ensuring all data was written (e.g., by unmounting the filesystem and using the 'sync' command), this message can be considered benign. To mitigate such warnings, ensure proper device removal procedures are followed, including unmounting filesystems and allowing sufficient time for write operations to complete before disconnecting or powering down storage devices.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'multipathd: sdb: pathinfo failed after change uevent' indicates that the multipath daemon encountered an issue retrieving path information for device 'sdb' following a udev change event. This message is typically benign and can occur during normal device addition or removal processes, especially if the device is in a transient state or if there are timing issues between udev and multipathd. In such cases, multipathd may attempt to access device information before udev has fully processed the device, leading to temporary failures in retrieving path information. This behavior is generally non-impacting and does not affect the overall reliability or availability of the system. To mitigate these transient errors, ensure that the multipath daemon and udev are properly synchronized, and consider configuring appropriate delays or retries in the multipath configuration to account for timing discrepancies. No immediate action is required unless these messages are persistent and accompanied by actual device access issues.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that systemd-logind failed to start the session scope 'session-c7.scope' due to a conflicting transaction involving 'umount.target'. This situation arises when systemd detects that a 'start' job for a unit contradicts an existing 'stop' job for the same or related units, leading to a 'destructive' transaction error. Such conflicts are typically transient and occur during rapid sequences of login and logout events, especially if previous sessions have not fully terminated. In this case, the 'umount.target' has a 'start' job queued, while a 'stop' is included in the transaction, causing the conflict. This behavior is documented in systemd discussions, where similar issues have been observed during session management. The impact on system reliability is minimal, as systemd is designed to handle such conflicts gracefully, and they do not indicate a persistent problem. To mitigate this, ensure that user sessions are properly terminated before initiating new ones, and consider updating systemd to the latest stable version, as improvements in session management have been made in recent releases. No immediate action is required unless this issue recurs frequently, in which case further investigation into session handling and systemd configuration may be warranted.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipathd daemon is encountering repeated 'pathinfo failed after change uevent' errors for devices sda, sdb, sdd, and sde. This suggests that multipathd is unable to retrieve path information following device change events, potentially due to issues with udev event processing or device path recognition. Such failures can lead to improper path management, risking data unavailability or corruption in Exadata/Exascale environments. This behavior can be reproduced by triggering device change events that multipathd fails to process correctly. To resolve this, ensure that the multipath configuration is accurate, particularly the 'uid_attribute' settings, and verify that udev rules are correctly configured to handle device events. Additionally, consider updating multipath-tools to a version that addresses known issues with uevent processing. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This error typically occurs when the specified IP address is not assigned to any network interface on the host at the time of the binding attempt. Possible causes include: 1) The IP address 10.32.101.247 is not configured on any of the server's network interfaces, leading to the inability to bind. 2) The network interface associated with this IP address was down or not yet initialized when sshd attempted to bind. 3) The ListenAddress directive in the sshd_config file specifies an IP address that is not currently available on the server. Despite this error, sshd may still be operational if it successfully binds to other available addresses, allowing SSH connections through those interfaces. To resolve this issue, verify that the IP address 10.32.101.247 is correctly assigned to an active network interface and that the interface is up. Additionally, review the sshd_config file to ensure that the ListenAddress directive corresponds to valid and active IP addresses on the server.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'kernel: sd 0:0:0:4: [sde] Synchronize Cache(10) failed: Result: hostbyte=DID_OK driverbyte=DRIVER_OK' indicates that the kernel attempted to synchronize the cache for the SCSI device 'sde' but encountered a failure. The 'hostbyte=DID_OK' and 'driverbyte=DRIVER_OK' suggest that the command was issued and processed without host or driver errors, implying the failure occurred at the device level. This message is commonly observed when a device is unexpectedly disconnected or powered off before the cache synchronization completes, particularly with external USB drives. In such scenarios, the failure is typically benign and does not indicate a hardware fault. To mitigate this, ensure that external storage devices are properly unmounted and safely removed using appropriate system commands before disconnection. This practice helps prevent such warnings and ensures data integrity.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'multipathd: sdd: pathinfo failed after change uevent' indicates that the multipath daemon encountered an issue while processing a udev change event for the device 'sdd'. This message typically arises when multipathd fails to retrieve path information following a udev event, often due to transient conditions such as device removal or reconfiguration. In the context of Exadata/Exascale systems, such messages are generally benign and do not impact system reliability or availability. They can occur during normal operations, including device rescans or path revalidations, and do not necessarily indicate a persistent problem. No immediate action is required unless these messages are frequent and correlate with actual device access issues. Monitoring the system for recurring patterns or associated errors can help determine if further investigation is warranted.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log indicates that the NetworkManager dispatcher script '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip' was terminated by signal 10 (SIGBUS) during the 'up' event for interface 're0'. This suggests a critical fault within the script, potentially due to a bug or misconfiguration. The '99-rdmaip' script is likely responsible for configuring RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) IP settings, which are crucial for high-performance networking in Exadata systems. A failure in this script can lead to improper RDMA configuration, adversely affecting network performance and reliability. To reproduce this issue, one can manually trigger the 'up' event for 're0' and monitor the execution of the '99-rdmaip' script. Resolution steps include reviewing the script for errors, ensuring all dependencies are correctly installed, and verifying compatibility with the current system environment. Given the critical nature of RDMA in Exadata, this incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that the Broadcom NetXtreme-C/E network interface cards (NICs) are failing to initialize Precision Time Protocol (PTP) functionality during driver initialization. This issue is commonly observed on older P3/P4 Broadcom chips, where the bnxt_en driver does not support PTP. The driver assumes that the firmware on these older chips will not return the PORT_MAC_PTP_QCFG_RESP_FLAGS_HWRM_ACCESS flag in the __bnxt_hwrm_ptp_qcfg() function, causing the function to abort quietly. However, newer firmware versions may set this flag, leading the function to proceed further and eventually fail in bnxt_ptp_init() -> bnxt_map_ptp_regs() because there is no code to support the older chips, resulting in the 'PTP initialization failed' message. This behavior does not impact the core networking functionality of the NICs, and the devices should operate normally aside from the PTP feature. To suppress these messages, updating the driver to a version that includes the patch to abort PTP initialization quietly on unsupported hardware is recommended. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and does not require further development review.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate a failure in the mlx5_core driver during the transition of a Queue Pair (QP) from INIT to RTR state, with the operation failing due to a 'bad parameter' error (status 0x3) and syndrome code 0x29e0df. This error is associated with the Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) over InfiniBand (IB) subsystem, specifically within the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) protocol, as evidenced by the subsequent 'RDS/IB: Failed to setup fastreg resources' message. The 'bad parameter' status suggests that the command parameters provided to the mlx5_core driver are invalid or incompatible with the hardware or firmware configuration. Similar issues have been reported in contexts where the mlx5 driver encounters 'bad parameter' errors during QP creation or modification, often due to mismatches between driver expectations and hardware capabilities. For instance, in cases where the kernel attempts to create QPs with free-running timestamps not supported by the hardware, such errors can occur. This issue can lead to the inability to establish RDMA connections, thereby affecting the reliability and availability of Exadata/Exascale systems that rely on RDMA for high-performance interconnects. To reproduce this issue, one could attempt to initialize RDMA connections over InfiniBand using the RDS protocol on a system with similar hardware and software configurations. Resolution steps include verifying the compatibility of the mlx5_core driver with the current kernel and firmware versions, ensuring that all parameters passed during QP initialization are valid and supported by the hardware, and consulting with hardware vendors for firmware updates or patches that address this specific error. Given the critical nature of this issue and its impact on RDMA functionality, it is imperative to address it promptly to maintain system reliability.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The error messages 'CELL-00201: CELLSRV services STARTUP failed' and 'CELL-01568: Cell interconnect is not configured' indicate that the CELLSRV service cannot start due to the absence of a configured interconnect interface. In Exadata systems, the interconnect is essential for communication between storage cells and database servers. Without a properly configured interconnect, the storage cell cannot participate in the cluster, leading to a loss of storage functionality and potential database unavailability. This issue can be reproduced by attempting to start CELLSRV without specifying the INTERCONNECT1 parameter during cell creation or alteration. To resolve this, configure the interconnect by executing the command 'cellcli -e create cell <cell_name> interconnect1=<interface>' or 'cellcli -e alter cell interconnect1=<interface>', replacing '<cell_name>' and '<interface>' with the appropriate values. After configuring the interconnect, restart the cell services using 'cellcli -e alter cell restart services all'.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'kernel: nvdimm: probe of nmem9 failed with error -5' indicates a failure during the initialization of the NVDIMM device identified as nmem9. In the Linux kernel, an error code of -5 corresponds to EIO, signifying an input/output error, which typically points to hardware malfunctions or critical communication issues with the device. Such failures can lead to the NVDIMM being placed in a read-only state or becoming entirely inaccessible, potentially resulting in data loss or system instability. This behavior aligns with documented cases where NVDIMM errors cause the system to restrict access to virtual machines or other dependent services. To address this issue, it is recommended to: 1) Verify the physical and logical connections of the NVDIMM to ensure proper seating and connectivity. 2) Utilize diagnostic tools such as 'ndctl' to assess the health status of the NVDIMM and identify any bad blocks or other anomalies. 3) Review system logs for additional error messages that may provide further context on the failure. 4) If the device is determined to be faulty, replace the NVDIMM module and restore data from backups as necessary. Given the critical nature of this error and its potential impact on system reliability, prompt investigation and remediation are essential.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log message 'RDS/IB: Failed to setup fastreg resources' indicates a failure in the Reliable Datagram Sockets (RDS) over InfiniBand (IB) subsystem during the setup of fast registration (fastreg) resources. This failure can prevent the establishment of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) operations, leading to degraded performance or complete unavailability of services relying on RDS over IB. A known issue in the RDS/IB implementation involves improper handling of the i_fastreg_wrs counter during early exits in the rds_ib_post_reg_frmr() function, which can lead to resource leaks and subsequent failures in setting up fastreg resources. This issue has been addressed in a series of patches, notably the one titled 'rds: ib: Increment i_fastreg_wrs before bailing out' by Håkon Bugge, which ensures the counter is correctly incremented to prevent resource leaks. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to apply the latest patches addressing this problem and ensure that the system is running a kernel version that includes these fixes.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The failure of the NetworkManager-wait-online.service indicates that the service did not detect the network as online within the configured timeout period. This service is designed to delay the network-online.target until NetworkManager reports that the network is fully operational, ensuring that services dependent on network connectivity start only after the network is ready. However, in many configurations, especially those where services can handle dynamic network changes, this service is not essential and its failure does not impact overall system functionality. Common causes for this failure include network interfaces not being ready in time, misconfigured network profiles, or the absence of active network connections during boot. To address this, you can either increase the timeout value in the NetworkManager-wait-online.service unit file or disable the service if it's not required for your setup. Disabling the service can be done using the command: systemctl disable NetworkManager-wait-online.service.

This error typically occurs when sshd is configured to listen on a specific IP address that is not currently assigned to any network interface on the host. Possible causes include: the IP address being removed or changed, the network interface being down, or the address being incorrectly specified in the sshd configuration. This issue does not directly impact Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability, as it pertains to SSH service configuration rather than core system functionality. To resolve this, verify that the IP address 10.32.238.108 is correctly assigned to an active network interface using 'ip addr show' or 'ifconfig'. If the address is not present, update the 'ListenAddress' directive in '/etc/ssh/sshd_config' to reflect a valid IP address or remove the directive to allow sshd to listen on all available interfaces. After making changes, restart the sshd service with 'systemctl restart sshd'.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'kernel: tsc: Marking TSC unstable due to TSCs unsynchronized' indicates that the Time Stamp Counter (TSC) has been deemed unreliable due to unsynchronized TSCs across CPUs. This condition can lead to significant performance degradation, as the system may switch from the high-resolution TSC to a less efficient clock source like the High Precision Event Timer (HPET). Such transitions are particularly impactful in high-performance environments like Exadata/Exascale systems, where precise timekeeping is crucial for optimal operation. The root cause often lies in hardware configurations, especially in multi-socket systems where TSC synchronization issues are more prevalent. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate a multi-socket environment with unsynchronized TSCs. Mitigation steps include ensuring BIOS settings are configured to synchronize TSCs across all CPUs and updating the system firmware to the latest version. Additionally, kernel parameters such as 'tsc=unstable' can be used to force the system to recognize the TSC as unstable, prompting the use of alternative clock sources. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple paths failing in the device-mapper multipath subsystem, with messages such as 'device-mapper: multipath: 252:16: Failing path 8:96.' This suggests that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is marking several paths as failed, potentially due to underlying hardware issues, misconfigurations, or transient errors. Such failures can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to storage devices, significantly impacting Exadata/Exascale system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Resolution steps include verifying the health and connectivity of all storage paths, checking for hardware faults, ensuring correct multipath configurations, and reviewing system logs for related errors. Similar issues have been documented, such as in Red Hat Bugzilla Bug 2018531, where multipath failure messages were observed after initiating I/O. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple systemd dependency failures related to essential mount points and swap devices, including /var/log/audit, /tmp, /crashfiles, and the swap partition labeled SWAP. These failures are due to timeouts when attempting to start the corresponding device units, such as dev-disk-by-label-AUDIT.device and dev-disk-by-label-SWAP.device. This suggests that the system is unable to detect or access these devices during boot, potentially due to hardware issues, misconfigured fstab entries, or missing device symlinks. The inability to mount critical filesystems and activate swap can lead to degraded system performance, logging failures, and compromised crash recovery capabilities. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate missing or inaccessible devices referenced in fstab. Resolution steps include verifying the existence and accessibility of the devices, ensuring correct fstab configurations, and checking for hardware malfunctions. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where systemd fails to mount filesystems due to device timeouts or misconfigurations. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry indicates that the NetworkManager dispatcher script '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip' was terminated by signal 10 (SIGBUS) during the 'up' event for interface 'clre0'. This suggests a critical fault within the script, potentially due to accessing misaligned memory or hardware issues. The '99-rdmaip' script is likely responsible for configuring RDMA IP addresses, and its failure can impede RDMA functionality, affecting high-speed data transfers crucial for Exadata/Exascale performance. To reproduce the issue, one could manually execute the script under similar conditions or monitor its behavior during network interface events. Resolution steps include reviewing the script for potential bugs, ensuring proper memory alignment, and verifying hardware integrity. Given the script's role in RDMA configuration, this incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This suggests a significant disruption in the storage connectivity, potentially due to issues such as SCSI reservation conflicts, hardware failures, or misconfigurations. Such failures can lead to degraded performance or complete unavailability of the affected storage devices, severely impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing SCSI reservation conflicts. Immediate investigation is required to identify the root cause, which may involve checking for SCSI reservation conflicts, verifying hardware integrity, and reviewing multipath configurations. Similar issues have been documented where SCSI reservations caused multipath to fail, even without underlying storage device issues.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that 'multipathd' is reporting multiple paths (e.g., sdg, sdj, sdl, etc.) failing with state 2 and dmstate 2. In the context of device-mapper multipath, state 2 typically signifies a path failure, and dmstate 2 indicates that the device-mapper is also recognizing the path as failed. This pattern suggests a systemic issue affecting multiple storage paths, which can lead to I/O disruptions and potential data unavailability. Such behavior can be reproduced by simulating path failures in a multipath setup, leading to similar log entries. To resolve this issue, it's recommended to: 1) Verify the physical connectivity and health of the storage paths; 2) Check for any recent changes in the storage configuration or firmware updates that might have introduced instability; 3) Review the multipath configuration for any misconfigurations or outdated settings; 4) Consult with the storage vendor to ensure compatibility and stability of the multipath setup. Similar issues have been documented where path failures lead to system crashes or unresponsiveness, emphasizing the critical nature of addressing such failures promptly. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This suggests a significant disruption in the storage connectivity, potentially leading to I/O errors or filesystem remounts in read-only mode, thereby affecting system reliability and availability. Such behavior can be reproduced by simulating path failures in a multipath setup, either through physical disconnection or by disabling paths at the storage level. To resolve this issue, it is recommended to verify the physical connections, ensure that the storage devices are properly configured and accessible, and review the multipath configuration for correctness. Additionally, consulting storage vendor documentation for specific multipath settings and failover configurations is advisable.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting multiple path failures across various devices (e.g., sdj, sdl, sdn, etc.), all showing state 2 and dmstate 2. This pattern suggests a systemic issue affecting the multipath configuration or the underlying storage paths. Such failures can lead to degraded performance, I/O errors, or complete loss of access to the affected storage devices, severely impacting system reliability and availability. Potential causes include hardware malfunctions, misconfigurations in the multipath setup, or issues with the storage array. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures in a controlled environment and observe the system's response. Immediate steps should include verifying the health and connectivity of the storage devices, reviewing the multipath configuration for correctness, and checking for any recent changes or updates that might have introduced this problem. Consulting the Red Hat documentation on troubleshooting DM Multipath may provide further insights into resolving such issues. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd failed to deactivate the swap device '/dev/mapper/VGExaDb-LVDbSwap1' during shutdown, resulting in exit-code failures for multiple swap unit aliases. This behavior is commonly observed when the swap device is still in use or locked by another process at the time of deactivation. In Exadata environments, the Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is often utilized for managing swap partitions, and such failures can occur if the swap volume is busy or if there are dependencies preventing its immediate deactivation. While these messages may seem concerning, they typically do not impact system reliability or availability, as the system proceeds with shutdown or reboot processes without significant issues. To mitigate these warnings, ensure that all processes utilizing swap are properly terminated before shutdown, and consider reviewing LVM configurations to confirm that no active dependencies exist on the swap volume during system halt. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'infiniband mlx5_0: ib_post_recv failed: -12' indicates a failure in posting receive work requests (WRs) on the InfiniBand device mlx5_0, with error code -12 corresponding to 'Out of Memory'. This issue is associated with a known race condition in the ib_mad_post_receive_mads() function, where concurrent MAD arrivals during port opening can lead to excessive WR postings, exceeding the queue pair's capacity. This results in failures such as the one observed. The problem can be reproduced by initiating MAD traffic during the port opening phase, leading to the described error. To resolve this, ensure that the system is running a kernel version that includes the patch titled 'IB/mad: Check available slots before posting receive WRs', which addresses this race condition by verifying available slots before posting new WRs. This patch has been incorporated into the 5.4-stable kernel tree. Additionally, verify that the InfiniBand drivers and firmware are up to date to prevent similar issues. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple systemd services failing due to timeouts when attempting to mount filesystems labeled as TMP, AUDIT, SWAP, and KDUMP. These failures result in the inability to mount essential directories such as /tmp, /var/log/audit, and /crashfiles, and prevent the activation of swap space. The root cause is likely that the devices corresponding to these labels are either missing, have been renamed, or their UUIDs have changed, leading to systemd's inability to locate and mount them. This situation can occur if the underlying storage devices have been removed, reconfigured, or if their identifiers have been altered without updating the system's configuration files. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the absence of these critical filesystems can lead to system instability, lack of auditing capabilities, and failure to capture crash dumps, which are vital for diagnosing system issues. To reproduce this behavior, one could remove or rename the storage devices associated with these labels without updating the system's fstab or other relevant configuration files. Resolution involves verifying the existence and correct labeling of the storage devices, updating /etc/fstab with the correct UUIDs or labels, and ensuring that all referenced devices are present and accessible at boot time. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where systemd encounters timeouts due to missing or misconfigured devices, leading to failed mount operations and degraded system functionality.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting repeated failures in synchronizing the state of multiple paths (e.g., sdi, sdk, sdm, etc.) with device-mapper states, all showing state 2. This suggests a persistent issue in the device-mapper multipath subsystem, potentially due to hardware path failures, misconfigurations, or software bugs. Such failures can lead to I/O disruptions, degraded performance, or complete loss of access to storage devices, severely impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures or misconfigure multipath settings. Resolution steps include verifying hardware connectivity, reviewing multipath configurations, and updating to the latest multipathd version to address known bugs. Similar issues have been reported in Red Hat Bugzilla, where multipathd becomes unresponsive after storage faults, necessitating a system reboot. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that systemd-logind failed to start session scopes due to a 'destructive' transaction error, where a 'start' job for the session scope conflicts with a 'stop' job for the poweroff.target. This situation typically arises during system shutdown or reboot sequences when new session initiations are attempted concurrently. The error is a result of systemd's job scheduling mechanism, which prevents conflicting operations to maintain system integrity. This behavior is documented in systemd discussions, where similar issues have been observed during shutdown processes. The impact on system reliability is minimal, as the system is already in the process of shutting down, and the failure to start new sessions does not affect the shutdown procedure. To reproduce this behavior, one could attempt to start a new session during an active shutdown sequence. No specific resolution is required, as this is expected behavior during shutdown. However, ensuring that user sessions are properly terminated before initiating a shutdown can prevent such log entries. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and is considered benign.

Such failures can lead to I/O disruptions, data unavailability, or system instability, especially in environments relying on multipath I/O for redundancy and performance. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Immediate investigation is required to identify the root cause, which may involve checking hardware components, verifying multipath configurations, and ensuring all paths are correctly recognized and operational. Additionally, reviewing system logs for related errors and consulting storage vendor documentation for known issues or firmware updates is advisable. Similar issues have been reported in environments where multipath configurations were not aligned with storage hardware capabilities, leading to path failures and system disruptions.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting multiple path failures across various devices (e.g., sdh, sdk, sdm, etc.), with both the path state and device-mapper state set to 2. In the context of multipathd, a state of 2 typically signifies a failed path, suggesting that these devices are currently inaccessible or experiencing significant I/O errors. This situation can lead to degraded performance or complete unavailability of the affected storage volumes, posing a serious risk to system reliability and data integrity. Such behavior can be reproduced by simulating path failures in a multipath setup, for instance, by disconnecting one of the redundant paths to a storage device. To mitigate this issue, it is recommended to: 1) Verify the physical connectivity and health of the storage devices and their paths; 2) Check for any recent changes in the storage configuration or firmware updates that might have affected path stability; 3) Review the multipath configuration (/etc/multipath.conf) for any misconfigurations or parameters that could influence path failover behavior; 4) Consult system logs for any hardware errors or kernel messages related to the affected devices. Similar issues have been documented, such as in Red Hat Bugzilla report 1698970, where device-mapper-multipath becomes unresponsive after storage faults, and in Red Hat Solution 3241281, detailing system crashes following dm-multipath path failures. Given the critical nature of this incident, immediate attention is required to prevent potential data loss or system downtime.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries from nm-dispatcher indicate that NetworkManager is unable to determine the device type for network interfaces 're0' and 're1'. This typically occurs when NetworkManager encounters interfaces it does not recognize or support, such as those managed by other subsystems or virtual interfaces. In Exadata/Exascale environments, certain network interfaces may be intentionally unmanaged by NetworkManager to allow specialized services to control them. This behavior is generally benign and does not impact system reliability or availability. To suppress these messages, consider configuring NetworkManager to ignore these interfaces by adding them to the 'unmanaged-devices' list in the NetworkManager configuration file. This approach is documented in the NetworkManager manual and is a common practice to prevent unnecessary log entries for interfaces not managed by NetworkManager.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd encountered errors when attempting to add PIDs to session scope control groups, resulting in 'No such process' errors and failures to start sessions for the root user. This issue is commonly observed in various Linux distributions and is often associated with transient processes terminating before systemd can assign them to control groups. Such behavior is typically benign and does not impact system reliability or availability. The errors can be reproduced by initiating short-lived processes that exit before systemd completes its cgroup assignment. To mitigate these messages, enabling user lingering for the root user has been effective, as it allows user services to persist beyond the user's active session. This can be achieved by executing 'loginctl enable-linger root'. Additionally, ensuring that the systemd version is up-to-date may help, as similar issues have been addressed in newer releases. Given the non-impacting nature of these messages, they can be considered benign noise in the system logs.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that multiple paths managed by the multipath daemon (multipathd) have been marked as failed, with specific devices (e.g., sdj, sdh, sdi) reporting path checker failures. This suggests a significant disruption in the multipath I/O subsystem, potentially leading to loss of redundancy and degraded performance. Such failures can result from hardware issues, misconfigurations, or software bugs. For instance, a known issue in device-mapper-multipath-0.8.4-28.el8 caused all paths to report as failed, which was resolved by downgrading to an earlier version. To reproduce this behavior, one could simulate path failures or introduce configuration errors in the multipath setup. Immediate steps should include verifying hardware connections, reviewing multipath configurations, and checking for known bugs in the current multipathd version. If the issue persists, consider downgrading or updating the multipathd package as appropriate.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'multipathd: sync_map_state: failing sdg state 2 dmstate 2' indicates that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is failing to synchronize the state of the device /dev/sdg, leading to its failure. This issue arises when multipathd does not update the internal path state after reinstating a previously failed path, causing the path to be failed again during state synchronization. This behavior matches a known bug addressed in a patch titled 'multipathd: cli_reinstate(): avoid reinstated paths being failed again' by Martin Wilck, dated July 2, 2025. The failure of a path in a multipath setup can lead to reduced redundancy and potential I/O disruptions, impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, manually fail a path, reinstate it, and observe the subsequent failure during state synchronization. The recommended resolution is to apply the patch mentioned above, which ensures that the internal path state is correctly updated upon reinstatement, preventing unnecessary path failures. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that 'multipathd' has detected multiple path failures across devices 'mpathg' and 'mpathh', suggesting a significant disruption in the multipath I/O subsystem. This condition can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to storage resources, severely impacting system reliability. Such failures may result from hardware issues (e.g., faulty cables, HBA failures), misconfigurations, or software bugs. To reproduce, simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Immediate investigation is required to identify and rectify the root cause, which may involve checking hardware connections, reviewing 'multipath.conf' settings, and analyzing system logs for related errors. Similar issues have been reported in environments using multipath configurations, emphasizing the need for prompt resolution to maintain system stability.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry indicates that the NetworkManager dispatcher script '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip' was terminated by signal 10 (SIGBUS) during the 'up' event for interface 'eth0'. This suggests a critical fault within the script, potentially due to an unaligned memory access or hardware-related issue. The failure of this script can impede the proper configuration of RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) interfaces, which are essential for high-performance networking in Exadata systems. To reproduce this issue, one could manually execute the script under similar conditions or monitor its behavior during network interface state changes. Resolution steps include reviewing the script for potential bugs, ensuring it handles all expected conditions gracefully, and verifying that all dependencies are correctly installed and accessible. Additionally, checking system logs for hardware errors or memory issues may provide further insights. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that 'multipathd' has detected multiple path failures across various devices (e.g., paths 8:144, 8:160, 8:128, etc.) within multipath maps 'mpathg' and 'mpathh'. This suggests a significant issue in the storage connectivity or path reliability. Potential causes include hardware failures (such as faulty HBAs, cables, or switches), misconfigurations in the multipath setup, or storage array issues. The impact on Exadata/Exascale systems could be severe, leading to degraded performance or complete loss of access to the affected storage volumes, which can disrupt database operations and compromise data availability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting specific storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Immediate steps should include verifying the physical connections, reviewing the multipath configuration for correctness, and checking the health of the storage devices. Additionally, consulting the 'multipathd' logs for more detailed error messages and using tools like 'multipath -ll' can provide further insights into the state of the paths.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting multiple path failures for devices such as sdj, sdi, sds, sdm, and sdt, all showing state 2 and dmstate 2. In the context of device-mapper multipathing, a state of 2 typically signifies a path failure, which can lead to I/O disruptions if alternative paths are unavailable or also failing. This pattern suggests a systemic issue with the storage subsystem, potentially due to hardware malfunctions, misconfigurations, or connectivity problems. Such failures can severely impact the reliability and availability of Exadata/Exascale systems, as they rely on consistent and redundant storage access. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures in a controlled environment by disconnecting storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network. Immediate investigation is recommended to identify the root cause, which may involve checking hardware connections, reviewing multipath configurations, and analyzing system logs for related errors. Similar issues have been documented, such as in Red Hat Bugzilla report 1698970, where device-mapper-multipath became unresponsive after storage faults, necessitating a system reboot.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is encountering repeated failures in synchronizing the state of multiple paths (sdi, sdk, sdm, sdo, sdg), all reporting 'state 2 dmstate 2'. In the context of multipathd, 'state 2' corresponds to a path being 'faulty', and 'dmstate 2' indicates that the device-mapper also recognizes the path as 'failed'. This scenario suggests that these paths are persistently failing, which can lead to I/O disruptions and degraded performance in a multipath I/O setup. Such behavior has been observed in environments with high I/O loads, where race conditions during path removal can result in multipath devices being left in an invalid state. For instance, a bug report (Bug #2039719) describes a situation where multipath devices are not removed correctly under high load, leading to similar issues. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate high I/O operations while dynamically adding and removing paths, observing if the multipath daemon fails to synchronize path states correctly. To mitigate this problem, ensure that the multipath-tools package is updated to the latest version, as patches addressing such race conditions have been released. Additionally, review the multipath configuration to ensure it aligns with best practices for your specific storage environment. If the issue persists after these steps, further investigation into the specific hardware and software interactions in your setup is warranted.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) has detected multiple path failures across different devices (e.g., paths 8:192, 8:176, 8:128, etc.) associated with multipath maps 'mpathe' and 'mpathf'. This suggests a significant issue within the storage subsystem, potentially due to hardware malfunctions, misconfigurations, or connectivity problems. Such path failures can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of redundancy, severely impacting the reliability and availability of the Exadata/Exascale system. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting specific storage paths or introducing faults in the storage network.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) is reporting multiple path failures for devices associated with the mpathg multipath map. Specifically, the 'checker failed path' and 'sync_map_state: failing' messages suggest that the path checker has detected issues with the specified paths, leading to their failure status. This behavior can result from various factors, including hardware malfunctions, SAN connectivity issues, or misconfigurations in the multipath setup. The repeated failure of multiple paths can severely impact the reliability and availability of the storage subsystem, potentially leading to data access disruptions or complete loss of redundancy. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting specific SAN connections or introducing faults in the storage network. Resolution steps include verifying the physical and logical connectivity of the affected paths, ensuring that all SAN components are functioning correctly, and reviewing the multipath configuration for any inconsistencies. Additionally, consulting the storage vendor's documentation for known issues related to path failures and applying recommended firmware or driver updates may be necessary. Similar issues have been documented in Red Hat Bugzilla, where multipath failure messages were observed after initiating I/O operations, highlighting the critical nature of such failures in enterprise environments.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The failure of the uptrack.service indicates that the Ksplice Uptrack service, responsible for applying kernel updates without rebooting, encountered an error during startup. This issue is commonly observed when the running kernel version isn't yet supported by Ksplice, leading to the service's inability to apply updates. Such failures are typically non-impacting, as they don't affect the immediate operation of the system but may delay the application of kernel patches. To address this, ensure that the system is running a kernel version supported by Ksplice. If the issue persists, consider disabling the uptrack.service to prevent recurring error messages. For more detailed troubleshooting steps, refer to Oracle's documentation on Ksplice updates not being applied.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that the SSH daemon (sshd) on scaqat11adm01.us.oracle.com attempted to bind to port 22 on IP address 10.214.197.76 but failed with the error 'Cannot assign requested address.' This error typically occurs when sshd is configured to listen on a specific IP address that is not currently assigned to any network interface on the system. Possible causes include: the specified IP address being removed or changed, the network interface being down, or the ListenAddress directive in the sshd_config file being set to an incorrect or non-existent IP address. To resolve this issue, verify the current IP addresses assigned to the system's network interfaces using the 'ifconfig' or 'ip addr' command. Ensure that the ListenAddress directive in /etc/ssh/sshd_config matches one of these assigned IP addresses. If the directive specifies an IP address that is no longer valid, update it to reflect the current configuration or remove the directive to allow sshd to listen on all available interfaces. After making changes, restart the sshd service to apply the new configuration. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and is considered a benign configuration issue that does not impact system reliability.

This widespread path failure suggests a significant disruption in the storage connectivity, potentially due to issues such as SCSI reservation conflicts, hardware malfunctions, or misconfigurations in the multipath setup. Such failures can lead to degraded performance or complete unavailability of the affected storage devices, severely impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting storage paths or introducing SCSI reservation conflicts. Immediate investigation is required to identify the root cause, which may involve checking for SCSI reservation conflicts, verifying hardware health, and reviewing multipath configurations. Similar issues have been documented where SCSI reservations caused multipath to fail, even without underlying storage device issues. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that the multipath daemon (multipathd) has detected multiple path failures across different devices (mpathb and mpathe). This suggests a significant issue in the storage connectivity or path configuration. Such failures can lead to reduced redundancy and potential I/O disruptions, especially if alternative paths are not available or also fail. Possible causes include hardware malfunctions, misconfigurations in the multipath setup, or issues with the storage array. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures by disconnecting specific storage paths or misconfiguring the multipath settings. Immediate steps should include verifying the physical connections, reviewing the multipath configuration for accuracy, and checking the health of the storage devices. Additionally, consulting the storage vendor's documentation for compatibility and known issues is advisable. Similar issues have been reported in environments using device-mapper-multipath, where path failures led to I/O disruptions. For instance, a Red Hat Customer Portal article discusses multipath path failures after updating to RHEL 8.7, resulting in all paths reporting as failed. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that udev is attempting to execute '/lib/udev/rename_device', but the file is missing, resulting in 'No such file or directory' errors. This suggests that a udev rule is referencing a script or binary that is not present on the system. Such errors are commonly observed when udev rules are outdated or when certain utilities have been deprecated or removed in newer system versions. For instance, similar issues have been reported where udev rules reference non-existent scripts, leading to benign error messages without impacting system functionality. To resolve this, identify the specific udev rule invoking '/lib/udev/rename_device' by examining the udev rules located in '/etc/udev/rules.d/' and '/lib/udev/rules.d/'. Once identified, the rule can be updated or removed to prevent the error messages.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry indicates that the dbus-daemon attempted to activate the 'org.freedesktop.resolve1' service via systemd but failed because the corresponding unit file 'dbus-org.freedesktop.resolve1.service' was not found. This typically occurs when systemd-resolved, the service responsible for network name resolution, is either not installed, disabled, or intentionally not in use. In such cases, NetworkManager or other services may still attempt to interact with systemd-resolved, leading to these benign log messages. This behavior is documented in various distributions, including Arch Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, where similar messages have been observed without impacting system functionality. To suppress these messages, you can configure NetworkManager to avoid using systemd-resolved by creating a configuration file at '/etc/NetworkManager/conf.d/no-systemd-resolved.conf' with the following content: '[main] systemd-resolved=false'. This instructs NetworkManager not to attempt communication with systemd-resolved, thereby preventing the generation of these log entries. Alternatively, if you prefer to use systemd-resolved, ensure that the service is installed and enabled by executing 'systemctl enable --now systemd-resolved'. In summary, while these log messages may be concerning, they do not indicate a critical issue affecting system reliability or availability.

Such failures can lead to I/O disruptions, degraded performance, or complete loss of access to the affected storage devices, significantly impacting system reliability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate path failures or misconfigure the multipath setup. Resolution steps include verifying hardware health, ensuring correct multipath configurations, and updating to the latest software versions. Similar issues have been documented, such as in Red Hat Bugzilla report 1698970, where device-mapper-multipath becomes unresponsive after storage faults. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd encountered an error while attempting to deactivate the swap device located at /dev/disk/by-label/SWAP. This issue is commonly observed when the swap device is already inactive or has been removed prior to the deactivation attempt. Such scenarios can occur if the swap partition was manually disabled, the underlying device was unmounted, or if there was a transient issue during shutdown. The error messages are typically benign and do not impact system reliability or availability. To prevent these messages from appearing, ensure that the swap device is properly configured and active during system operations. If the swap device is no longer needed, consider removing or commenting out its entry in /etc/fstab to prevent systemd from attempting to manage it. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where systemd fails to activate or deactivate swap due to misconfigurations or device availability changes. For instance, a Red Hat knowledge base article discusses a scenario where systemd fails to activate swap due to a missing device, resulting in similar error messages. Therefore, this incident is considered non-critical and does not require immediate attention.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that systemd is failing to mount remote file systems located under /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages due to device timeout errors. Specifically, device units such as dev-exc-scaqax01dv0401m_cfg_309338966af24219994a2bdaf7ca2028.device are timing out, leading to dependency failures for the corresponding mount units and the remote-fs.target. This suggests that the devices backing these mount points are either unavailable or experiencing significant delays during the boot process. Such failures can prevent critical services from starting, potentially leading to system instability or unavailability. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate device unavailability or introduce delays in device initialization during boot. Resolution steps include verifying the availability and health of the storage devices, ensuring that all necessary drivers are loaded correctly, and checking for any misconfigurations in systemd unit files related to these mounts. Additionally, reviewing system logs for hardware errors or driver issues may provide further insights. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The failure of systemd-logind.service to start due to a timeout indicates a significant issue within the system's initialization process. This service is integral to managing user logins and sessions; its failure can lead to an inability to authenticate users, potentially rendering the system inaccessible. Such timeouts are often associated with deadlocks between systemd and the D-Bus service, as documented in various cases where systemd services fail to activate due to D-Bus timeouts. This behavior can be reproduced by simulating conditions that cause D-Bus to become unresponsive, leading to systemd services timing out during startup. To resolve this issue, a system reboot is typically recommended to restore normal operation. However, if the problem persists, further investigation into the D-Bus and systemd interactions is necessary to identify and address the root cause.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry indicates that the SSH daemon (sshd) on host 'scaqax01adm04.us.oracle.com' failed to bind to port 22 on IP address 10.133.44.200, resulting in the error 'Cannot assign requested address.' This error typically occurs when the specified IP address is not assigned to any network interface on the host at the time sshd attempts to bind to it. Possible causes include: (1) The IP address 10.133.44.200 is not configured on any active network interface of the host, leading to the inability of sshd to bind to it. (2) The network interface associated with 10.133.44.200 is down or not yet initialized when sshd starts, causing the binding failure. (3) The 'ListenAddress' directive in the sshd configuration file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) specifies 10.133.44.200, but this address is not available on the host. This issue can prevent remote SSH access to the system, impacting administrative capabilities and potentially affecting Exadata/Exascale operations. To resolve this issue, verify that 10.133.44.200 is correctly assigned to an active network interface on the host. If the IP address is intended to be used, ensure that the corresponding network interface is up and properly configured. Additionally, review the 'ListenAddress' directive in /etc/ssh/sshd_config to confirm it matches the available network configuration. If the IP address is not intended for use, remove or correct the 'ListenAddress' directive to prevent sshd from attempting to bind to an unavailable address.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'dracut: installkernel failed in module kernel-modules-extra' indicates that during the initramfs generation process, dracut encountered an issue while attempting to include the 'kernel-modules-extra' module. This module typically contains additional kernel drivers that are not essential for the core functionality of the system. Such failures often occur when dracut is configured to include modules that are either missing or not applicable to the current system configuration. In this context, the failure to include 'kernel-modules-extra' is unlikely to impact the system's reliability or availability, as the core modules necessary for booting and operation are typically included separately. To address this issue, review the dracut configuration files located in '/etc/dracut.conf.d/' to ensure that only relevant modules are specified for inclusion. If 'kernel-modules-extra' is not required for your system's operation, it can be safely omitted from the configuration to prevent these warnings in future initramfs builds. This behavior is consistent with known scenarios where dracut attempts to include non-existent or unnecessary modules, resulting in benign warnings that do not affect system functionality.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that systemd is failing to mount remote file systems located under /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages, with specific device units timing out during startup. This suggests a misconfiguration or failure in the remote file system setup, potentially due to incorrect fstab entries or network issues preventing access to the specified mounts. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as these failures can prevent essential services from starting, leading to degraded system functionality or complete service outages. This behavior can be reproduced by configuring remote file system mounts in fstab without ensuring network availability or correct mount options, leading to dependency failures during boot. To resolve this issue, verify the fstab entries for accuracy, ensure that the network is available before mounting remote file systems, and consider using the 'x-systemd.automount' option to allow systemd to handle the mounts more gracefully. Additionally, the 'session-1.scope' failure indicates a problem with managing user sessions, which could be related to the aforementioned mount failures or a separate issue with systemd's session management.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate that systemd is failing to mount remote file systems located under /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages due to device timeout errors. Specifically, devices such as dev-exc-scaqax01dv0604m_cfg_59a0f1089a3d44e392b3e23c22b33a46.device are timing out, leading to dependency failures for the corresponding mount units and the remote-fs.target. This suggests that the system is unable to access or recognize the specified devices, potentially due to hardware issues, misconfigurations, or network problems affecting remote storage. The impact is significant, as it prevents the mounting of essential remote file systems, which can disrupt services relying on these mounts. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate the unavailability of the specified devices or introduce network disruptions affecting remote storage access. Resolution steps include verifying the availability and connectivity of the devices, checking for hardware faults, ensuring correct systemd unit configurations, and reviewing network settings. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where systemd encounters timeouts waiting for devices, leading to dependency failures and emergency modes. For instance, users have experienced system hangs due to device timeouts, resulting in dependency failures for file systems and services. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The log entry 'kexec_file: Enforced kernel signature verification failed (-126)' indicates a failure in the kexec_file_load() system call due to an invalid or untrusted kernel image signature. This failure is critical as it prevents the loading of a new kernel image, which is essential for operations like kdump or live kernel updates. The error code (-126) suggests that the signature verification process encountered an issue, possibly due to the kernel image being unsigned, signed with an untrusted key, or the absence of necessary keyrings. This behavior can be reproduced by attempting to load a kernel image that lacks a valid signature or is signed with a key not present in the system's trusted keyrings. To resolve this issue, ensure that the kernel image is properly signed with a key recognized by the system's trusted keyrings, such as .builtin_trusted_keys, .secondary_trusted_keys, or .platform keyrings. Additionally, verify that the CONFIG_KEXEC_SIG option is enabled in the kernel configuration to enforce signature verification during kexec operations. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate a failure in the mlx5_core driver during the transition of a Queue Pair (QP) from INIT to RTR state, with the operation failing due to a 'bad parameter' error (status 0x3) and syndrome code 0x29e0df. This failure is accompanied by the RDS/IB subsystem's inability to set up fast registration (fastreg) resources. Such errors can stem from mismatches between the driver and firmware versions, or from misconfigurations in the Real-Time Clock (RTC) settings of the adapter. Similar issues have been documented where kernel versions prior to 5.12 lacked support for the adapter's RTC functionality, leading to QP creation failures. To address this, ensure that the system is running a kernel version that supports the adapter's RTC features, and verify that the mlx5_core driver and firmware are compatible and up to date. Additionally, consider disabling the RTC feature on the adapter using the Mellanox Firmware Tools (MFT) if the kernel does not support it. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entry 'systemd: Failed unmounting /opt/oracle.' indicates that during system shutdown, the /opt/oracle mount point could not be unmounted, likely due to active processes or open file handles within that directory. This is a common occurrence when services or applications do not terminate cleanly before the unmount operation. In the context of Exadata/Exascale systems, /opt/oracle is typically used for Oracle software installations, and such unmount failures during shutdown are generally benign, as they do not impact system reliability or availability. To mitigate this, ensure that all Oracle-related services are properly stopped before initiating a shutdown. Additionally, reviewing the system logs to identify which processes are preventing the unmount can help in addressing the issue. This behavior can be reproduced by initiating a system shutdown while processes are still accessing files within /opt/oracle. No immediate action is required unless this issue is accompanied by other errors or system instability.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple systemd services failing due to timeouts when attempting to start device units associated with specific disk labels (e.g., KDUMP, TMP, AUDIT, SWAP). This suggests that the system is unable to detect or access these disk partitions during boot, leading to cascading failures in mounting essential filesystems and starting dependent services. The failure of kdump.service, responsible for crash recovery kernel arming, is particularly concerning as it impairs the system's ability to capture crash dumps, which are vital for diagnosing system failures. This issue can be reproduced by configuring /etc/fstab with entries for non-existent or misconfigured disk partitions, causing systemd to timeout while waiting for these devices. To resolve this, verify the existence and correct labeling of the specified partitions using lsblk and blkid commands, and ensure that /etc/fstab entries match the actual system configuration. Additionally, check for any hardware issues or misconfigurations that might prevent the system from recognizing these partitions. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where systemd experiences timeouts due to missing or misconfigured disk entries, leading to boot delays and service failures. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The logs indicate multiple systemd dependency failures due to timeouts when attempting to mount devices labeled AUDIT, SWAP, KDUMP, and TMP. These failures suggest that the system is unable to access or identify the specified storage devices, potentially due to hardware issues, misconfigured or missing entries in /etc/fstab, or changes in device identifiers (UUIDs or labels). This situation can lead to significant system instability, including the inability to perform crash dumps (kdump), lack of swap space, and failure to mount critical directories like /tmp and /var/log/audit, all of which are essential for system reliability and security. To reproduce this issue, one could simulate missing or misconfigured fstab entries or disconnect the relevant storage devices. Resolution steps include verifying the existence and correct labeling of the devices, ensuring that /etc/fstab entries match the current device identifiers (using 'blkid' to confirm), and checking for hardware connectivity issues. Similar issues have been reported in various Linux distributions, where incorrect fstab entries or missing devices cause systemd to fail during boot, leading to timeouts and dependency failures.

Severity Assessment: Critical – The repeated kernel messages 'crash hp: kexec_trylock() failed, elfcorehdr may be inaccurate' indicate a failure in the kexec mechanism, which is essential for loading crash dump kernels in Exadata systems. This failure suggests that the system is unable to capture crash dumps, potentially due to issues with the kexec_trylock() function failing to acquire necessary locks, leading to an inaccurate ELF core header. Such behavior can be reproduced by attempting to load a crash kernel using kexec on systems with similar configurations. To resolve this issue, ensure that the kexec-tools package is up to date, as earlier versions have known bugs affecting crash kernel loading. Additionally, verify that the system's firmware and kernel configurations are compatible with kexec operations. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that systemd-logind encountered 'destructive' transactions when attempting to start 'user@1000.service' and 'session-c25.scope'. This typically occurs when conflicting start and stop jobs are queued simultaneously, leading systemd to prevent potentially harmful operations. Such scenarios can arise during rapid user logins and logouts or when services are being restarted concurrently. While these messages may seem concerning, they are generally benign and do not impact system reliability. To mitigate these warnings, ensure that user sessions and related services are managed sequentially, avoiding overlapping start and stop requests. No immediate action is required unless these messages are accompanied by actual service failures or user session issues.

Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The log entries indicate that systemd-logind encountered conflicts when attempting to start user services and session scopes due to pending stop jobs for related units. This situation arises when systemd detects that initiating a unit would contradict an already queued stop operation, leading to the 'Transaction is destructive' error. Such conflicts are typically transient and occur during rapid sequences of user logins and logouts or when services are being restarted. They do not usually impact the overall reliability or availability of the system, as systemd is designed to handle these scenarios gracefully. To mitigate these warnings, ensure that user sessions and related services are properly terminated before initiating new ones, and avoid rapid consecutive restarts of services. Monitoring the system's behavior over time can help confirm that these messages are benign and do not indicate underlying issues.
