The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the systemd-logind.service, which is essential for managing user logins and sessions in an Oracle Linux environment. The failure of this service with a 'timeout' result, as seen in the log window, suggests a potential issue with system initialization or resource availability that prevents the login service from starting within the expected timeframe. This failure can severely impact system usability, as it may prevent users from logging in, thereby affecting overall system availability on an Exadata or Exascale platform. The root cause could be related to underlying resource constraints, misconfigurations in systemd, or dependencies failing to start properly. Reproducing this issue might involve simulating high system load or intentionally delaying dependent services to trigger a timeout during boot.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where multiple critical mount points and services have failed to start due to dependency issues and timeouts. The log window indicates failures in mounting essential filesystems such as /tmp, swap, /crashfiles, and /var/log/audit, alongside the failure of kdump.service, which is crucial for crash recovery kernel arming. The likely technical root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or unavailability of disk devices labeled for these mount points, leading to timeouts during the boot process as systemd cannot resolve the dependencies. This situation severely impacts system reliability and availability, as missing swap space can lead to memory management issues, and failure of kdump.service prevents proper crash dump collection, hindering diagnostics of other failures. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating a scenario where the labeled disk devices are unavailable or incorrectly configured in /etc/fstab or systemd unit files during boot. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the disk labels and device availability using 'blkid' and 'lsblk', checking /etc/fstab for correct entries, and ensuring that systemd units are properly configured with appropriate timeout values or dependencies.

This incident involves systemd failing to deactivate multiple swap devices during a system operation, likely a shutdown or service restart, as evidenced by the repeated 'Failed deactivating swap' messages across various device paths in the log window. The component in focus is systemd, which is critical for managing system services and resources like swap spaces in an Oracle Linux environment, often used in Exadata systems. The likely root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or failure in the logical volume management (LVM) setup for the swap devices, or a potential issue with device-mapper not releasing the resources properly, leading to the 'exit-code' failure result. This behavior could impact system reliability by preventing proper resource cleanup, potentially causing memory management issues or system hangs during reboots or service transitions, which are critical in high-availability Exadata environments. Reproduction of this issue might be achieved by simulating a system shutdown or swap deactivation command under similar LVM configurations to observe if systemd consistently fails to release the swap devices. As a resolution, I recommend checking the LVM configuration for errors, ensuring that swap devices are not in use or locked by other processes, and verifying systemd's unit files for swap management for any misconfigurations; if necessary, manually deactivate swap using 'swapoff' commands before system operations.

The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the failure of systemd-networkd.socket, which is responsible for managing network configurations through systemd-networkd. The log messages indicate multiple issues, including the inability to determine peer security context due to protocol unavailability and failure to load configuration for usr.mount, suggesting potential misconfiguration or missing critical files. The most severe issue is the failure of systemd-networkd.socket to queue service startup, transitioning to a failed state, which likely disrupts network service initialization and connectivity. This can significantly impact Exadata/Exascale system reliability by preventing proper network communication, critical for distributed operations and cluster management. Reproducing this behavior could involve intentionally misconfiguring or removing the systemd-networkd service files or dependencies on a test system to observe similar failures. Recommended resolution includes verifying the presence and correctness of systemd-networkd configuration files, ensuring proper SELinux or security module configurations, and restarting the systemd-networkd.socket unit after corrections. Supporting evidence aligns with known systemd issues where missing or corrupt service files lead to startup failures, as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides and Oracle Linux resources.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/", "additional_sources": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/ - Official systemd documentation for troubleshooting socket failures;https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/ - Reference for systemd-networkd issues in enterprise environments", "log_window": "systemd: Failed to determine peer security context: Protocol not available\nsystemd: Failed to load configuration for usr.mount: No such file or directory\nsystemd: systemd-networkd.socket failed to queue service startup job (Maybe the service file is missing or not a non-template unit?): Transaction is destructive.\nsystemd: systemd-networkd.socket changed listening -> failed\nsystemd: Unit systemd-networkd.socket entered failed state.", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 5, "message_structure": "systemd: failed to determine peer security context: protocol not available\nsystemd: failed to load configuration for usr.mount: no such file or directory\nsystemd: systemd-networkd.socket failed to queue service startup job (maybe the service file is missing or not a non-template unit?): transaction is destructive.\nsystemd: systemd-networkd.socket changed listening -> failed\nsystemd: unit systemd-networkd.socket entered failed state.", "k0_sim": 0.6187611818313599, "i0_sim": 0.5926713943481445}
{"incident_id": "0b21b5431536", "host": "scaqah07adm03", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.9, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. The incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread failures in sending unit remove signals across a vast array of services and targets, including critical Exadata-specific services like oracle-ohasd.service, exadata.target, and exachkcfg.service. The likely technical root cause appears to be a systemic communication breakdown within systemd, as evidenced by repeated 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' errors, potentially triggered by a socket or IPC failure during a system shutdown or reboot sequence. This behavior severely impacts Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as it indicates that systemd is unable to properly manage service states, which could lead to improper resource cleanup, stalled shutdowns, or failure to transition system states, affecting database and grid infrastructure operations. Reproduction of this issue might occur during system shutdown or reboot under high load or when systemd's internal state is corrupted, possibly due to a race condition or resource exhaustion. Recommended resolution steps include analyzing journalctl logs for preceding errors, verifying systemd version and known bugs in the deployed Oracle Linux release, applying any relevant patches, and potentially restarting systemd or rebooting the system with monitoring to capture additional context. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected services and targets, including network, storage, and RDMA components, which collectively suggest a critical failure rather than an isolated issue, consistent with known systemd behaviors under stress or misconfiguration as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, failing to mount multiple remote file systems and associated device configurations under the /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages path, which appears to be critical for Exadata/Exascale virtual machine image management. The likely technical root cause is a timeout in device initialization (as seen in 'result 'timeout'' for multiple dev-exc-* devices), possibly due to underlying storage or network connectivity issues preventing the devices from becoming available within the expected timeframe. This failure cascades to dependency issues for remote-fs.target and specific mount points, ultimately impacting session initialization for the root user, which suggests a broader system initialization problem. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the inability to mount guest image file systems could disrupt virtual machine operations or database services reliant on these mounts, potentially leading to service outages. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage or network delay during system boot or by misconfiguring the fstab or systemd mount units for these paths. Recommended resolution steps include verifying network and storage connectivity to the backend providing these devices, checking systemd timeout configurations for mount and device units, and reviewing logs for preceding errors in storage or network subsystems.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting multiple dependency failures related to remote file systems and device configurations in an Exadata environment. The root cause appears to be a timeout in device initialization jobs for multiple VM configuration devices, as evidenced by repeated 'timeout' results in the log window for paths like dev-exc-scaqaw03adm04vmXX_cfg_*.device, which subsequently causes mount failures for /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages paths and impacts remote-fs.target. This behavior likely disrupts the availability of critical file systems required for Exadata VM guest images, potentially leading to service interruptions or incomplete system boots for multiple VMs. The issue could be reproduced by simulating a delay or failure in the underlying storage or network layer that systemd depends on for device detection during boot. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the storage connectivity for the affected device paths, checking for underlying hardware or network issues, and reviewing systemd unit configurations for overly strict timeout settings or missing dependencies. Supporting evidence includes the consistent pattern of 'timeout' failures across multiple device jobs and the cascading effect on mount and remote file system targets, which aligns with known systemd behavior when underlying resources are unavailable during initialization.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/",

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically relating to SCSI disk operations where multiple drives (sde, sdf, sdg, sdh) report failures during a Synchronize Cache operation with the error code hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST and driverbyte=DRIVER_OK. The technical root cause likely stems from a transport layer issue, possibly due to a temporary disconnection, faulty cabling, or a failure in the storage controller within the Exadata/Exascale environment, disrupting communication between the host and the storage devices. The impact on system reliability is significant as these errors can lead to data integrity issues or potential data loss if the cache cannot be synchronized properly during write operations, affecting availability of critical storage resources.

This incident involves the kernel component with specific failures in device-mapper multipath paths and RDS/IB connectivity, indicating a severe issue in the storage and network layers of an Exadata/Exascale system. The repeated failing paths (e.g., 8:80, 8:96, 65:0) suggest a systemic problem with storage multipath configurations or underlying hardware, potentially due to SAN connectivity loss, misconfigured multipathd, or disk failures. Additionally, the RDS/IB reconnect stalling for over a minute with packet drops points to InfiniBand network instability, which is critical for high-performance clustering in Exadata environments. The impact on system reliability and availability is high, as multipath failures can lead to data unavailability, and RDS/IB issues can disrupt database clustering and performance. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of heavy I/O load, network congestion, or by simulating path failures via manual intervention on the storage or InfiniBand network.

The log window and message structure indicate multiple path failures across various maps (mpathe, mpathf, mpathg, mpathh) with consistent failing states (state 2, dmstate 2), suggesting a systemic issue with path availability or storage connectivity rather than an isolated disk failure. The likely root cause could be a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, a SAN fabric issue, or a failure in the underlying storage array communication, leading to repeated path checker failures. The impact on system reliability is significant, as loss of multiple paths can result in degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical storage resources, potentially causing database downtime or data unavailability. This behavior might be reproduced by simulating a storage controller failure or disconnecting multiple paths in a test environment to observe multipathd's response. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the SAN fabric connectivity, checking multipath.conf for incorrect settings, and reviewing storage array logs for errors or alerts. Supporting evidence comes from known issues in Device Mapper Multipath where path failures cascade due to improper failover configurations or hardware faults, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage guides.

This incident involves a kernel-level error related to the PM-Timer, which is a critical hardware timing mechanism used by the system for power management and timekeeping functions. The message structure 'kernel: pm-timer failed consistency check (<hex>) - aborting' indicates a failure in the timer's integrity check, with the specific log entry showing a hexadecimal value of 0xffffff, suggesting a complete failure or invalid state. The likely root cause is a hardware issue with the system's timer circuitry or a firmware bug in the BIOS/UEFI that mishandles the PM-Timer interface, potentially leading to system instability or incorrect timekeeping. This error can severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability, as accurate timing is essential for database operations, cluster synchronization, and RDMA communications. Reproduction of this issue might occur under specific power management state transitions or heavy system load, though it often depends on underlying hardware conditions. Recommended resolution includes immediate checking of BIOS/UEFI versions against Oracle's supported firmware list, applying updates if necessary, and running hardware diagnostics to rule out chipset or motherboard faults.

{"incident_id": "e43c9177140e", "host": "scaqae03adm05", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.9, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager, exhibiting widespread communication failures across multiple services and units on an Exadata system. The log window shows repeated errors such as 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' for critical Exadata-specific services like exadata-netdiag-dump.service, exadata-dbproc-bind.service, and exadata.target, alongside fundamental system services like dbus.service and sshd.service. The likely root cause appears to be a systemic failure in systemd's inter-process communication mechanism, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus failure under high load or resource exhaustion, leading to an inability to manage or signal services effectively. This behavior severely impacts Exadata reliability and availability, as essential services fail to start, stop, or communicate status, potentially causing database or storage node outages. Reproduction could likely be triggered by simulating high system load or inducing D-Bus/socket failures during boot or service restarts. Recommended resolution includes immediate restart of systemd or the affected node if safe, followed by analysis of resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors) and checking systemd journal for prior warnings; applying Oracle Linux updates for systemd may also mitigate known bugs. Supporting evidence lies in the pervasive nature of the errors across unrelated services, a pattern often seen in systemic D-Bus or systemd socket issues as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat knowledge bases.

{"incident_id": "e4cda09e1354", "host": "scaqae03adm05", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.85, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting multiple failure conditions that disrupt normal system operation. The log messages indicate a failure to determine peer security context due to an unavailable protocol, suggesting potential issues with SELinux or security module configurations, alongside a failure to load configuration for usr.mount, which may point to a misconfigured or missing mount unit file critical for system boot. Additionally, the systemd-networkd.socket entering a failed state due to a destructive transaction and inability to queue a startup job strongly suggests a systemic issue with network service initialization, likely caused by a missing or corrupted service file. This combination of errors can severely impact system reliability, potentially preventing proper network functionality and system stability during boot or runtime. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a corrupted or missing systemd-networkd service file or by disabling necessary security protocols in the system configuration. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the integrity of systemd unit files, particularly for systemd-networkd.socket and usr.mount, ensuring SELinux is properly configured, and reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors that might have triggered these failures.

{"incident_id": "f7b432aa91f6", "host": "scaqae03adm05", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.9, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread failures in communication and unit management during what appears to be a system shutdown or reboot sequence. The log window shows repeated errors such as 'Failed to send unit remove signal' with 'Transport endpoint is not connected' across a vast array of services and devices, indicating a systemic issue in systemd's ability to gracefully handle unit termination, likely due to a socket or D-Bus communication breakdown. Additionally, errors like 'Failed to determine peer security context: Protocol not available' suggest potential issues with SELinux or security context handling, which could exacerbate the problem. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as this behavior can lead to improper service shutdown, potential data corruption, or failure to reboot correctly, affecting critical database and storage operations. This issue could potentially be reproduced by initiating a system shutdown or reboot under similar conditions, possibly with a misconfigured systemd or during high system load. Recommended resolution includes verifying systemd configuration files for errors, checking for SELinux policy mismatches, and reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors that might have triggered this cascade. If unresolved, escalating to Oracle Support for a deeper analysis of systemd and kernel interactions is advised. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected services and the consistent error pattern, which aligns with known systemd issues in Oracle Linux environments under specific failure conditions.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/8/systemd/index.html", "additional_sources":

The incident involving systemd indicates a critical failure of the dbserverd.service, which has transitioned to a failed state as evidenced by the log entries. This component is crucial for database server operations within an Exadata environment, and its failure likely stems from missing or misconfigured service dependencies or mount points, as suggested by the extensive list of 'failed to load configuration' errors for various mounts and services. The impact on Exadata reliability is significant, as the failure of dbserverd.service could disrupt database availability and affect overall system performance. This behavior might be reproducible by simulating a misconfiguration or deletion of critical systemd unit files or mount configurations during system boot or service restart. To mitigate this, immediate steps should include verifying the integrity of systemd configuration files, ensuring all required mount points are correctly defined in /etc/fstab or related configs, and restarting the dbserverd.service after resolving dependencies. Supporting evidence includes the explicit log entries about the service entering a failed state, which aligns with known systemd behavior when critical dependencies are unmet, often documented in Oracle Linux and systemd troubleshooting guides. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

{"incident_id": "c8cbfc129cd5", "host": "scaqae03adm05", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.85, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, critical to the operation of Exadata/Exascale systems. The log window shows widespread failures in systemd's ability to manage services and units, with repeated errors such as 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' across a broad range of services including sshd, crond, rsyslog, and Exadata-specific units like exadata.target and exawatcher.service. These errors suggest a systemic communication breakdown within systemd, likely caused by a failure in the D-Bus communication layer or a corrupted systemd state, potentially triggered by a system crash, resource exhaustion, or improper shutdown. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as critical services failing to start or communicate can lead to loss of system functionality, monitoring, and management capabilities. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of sudden system termination or high resource contention affecting systemd's control socket. Recommended resolution includes restarting the systemd daemon if possible, inspecting journalctl for preceding errors, and verifying system resource availability; if unresolved, a system reboot may be necessary to reset the state. Supporting evidence includes the pattern of errors affecting multiple unrelated services simultaneously, which aligns with known systemd issues under stress or failure conditions as documented in upstream systemd and Oracle Linux resources.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/", "additional_sources":

The likely technical root cause appears to be a systemic communication breakdown within systemd, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus failure during a system shutdown or reboot sequence, leading to an inability to properly manage service termination. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as this behavior can result in improper service shutdowns, potential data corruption, or incomplete resource release, affecting critical components like oracle-ohasd.service and exadata-specific services. This issue could likely be reproduced during a system reboot or forced shutdown under heavy load or with a misconfigured systemd environment. Recommended resolution includes immediate investigation into systemd logs and D-Bus status prior to the incident, checking for underlying network or socket issues, and potentially updating systemd to a patched version if a known bug is identified. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected services and targets in the log, which aligns with known systemd issues in high-complexity environments like Oracle Exadata, where improper shutdown sequences have historically caused cascading failures. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

{"incident_id": "f18154094bbd", "host": "scaqae03adm05", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.85, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread failures in unmounting filesystems and sending unit remove signals across a vast array of services and devices during what appears to be a system shutdown or reboot sequence. The likely technical root cause is a systemic failure in systemd's communication mechanism, as evidenced by repeated 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' errors, suggesting a breakdown in socket or inter-process communication possibly due to an abrupt termination or resource exhaustion. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as this behavior indicates potential data corruption risks from improper unmounting (e.g., /proc/xen and boot-efi.mount failures) and failure to cleanly stop critical services like ohasd and rdma-related units, which could disrupt database and network operations. This issue could likely be reproduced during a forced shutdown or under high system load conditions where systemd struggles to manage resource cleanup, potentially triggered by a kernel panic or manual intervention. Recommended resolution steps include analyzing preceding logs for kernel or hardware errors that might have precipitated this state, ensuring systemd is updated to the latest stable version to address known bugs, and verifying system resource limits to prevent exhaustion scenarios. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected units, including Exadata-specific services like exadata-capacity-on-demand and exachkcfg, pointing to a cascading failure with broader implications, consistent with known systemd issues under stress as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat knowledge bases. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

The incident involving the multipathd component indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths being marked as failed across several multipath maps (mpathb, mpathc, mpathd) and individual devices (sda, sdc, sde, sdg, sdi, sdk). This behavior suggests a systemic failure in the storage subsystem, potentially due to a hardware issue with the underlying disks, a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, or a failure in the storage controller or SAN connectivity. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the loss of multiple paths can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical storage resources, potentially causing database or application downtime. This issue could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage hardware failure or disconnecting multiple paths in a test environment to observe multipathd behavior. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of physical storage connectivity, checking for hardware errors in logs like /var/log/messages or dmesg, running multipath -ll to inspect path states, and potentially reconfiguring or reinitializing the multipath setup if no hardware fault is found.

{"incident_id": "b5011f7fb3f9", "host": "scaqae03adm06", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.85, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread communication failures across multiple services and targets on an Exadata system. The log window and message structure reveal repeated errors such as 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' affecting critical Exadata-specific units like exadata.target, exadata-netdiag-dump.service, and EXAVMIMAGES.mount, alongside fundamental system services like dbus, sshd, and rsyslog. The likely root cause appears to be a systemic failure in systemd's inter-process communication mechanism, possibly due to a socket or cgroup management issue, as evidenced by failures to destroy cgroups and propagate agent release messages. This behavior severely impacts system reliability and availability, as it disrupts service state management and could prevent proper initialization or shutdown of critical Exadata components. Reproduction might involve triggering a high load or abrupt termination of systemd-managed processes to simulate socket disconnection or resource contention. Recommended resolution includes restarting systemd or rebooting the node to reset communication channels, followed by checking journalctl for preceding errors and verifying systemd version compatibility with Oracle Linux on Exadata. Supporting evidence includes the failure of systemd-networkd.socket entering a failed state, which indicates a deeper issue in network service initialization, and known systemd issues in Oracle Linux environments under heavy load or misconfiguration scenarios. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, which is failing to send unit remove signals for a wide array of services and targets during a shutdown or reboot process. The repeated 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' errors across multiple units, including critical Exadata-specific services like exachkcfg.service and exavmnetwork.service, suggest a systemic issue with systemd's communication mechanism, potentially due to a socket or D-Bus failure under load or during an abrupt termination. The root cause likely stems from a timing issue or resource contention during the shutdown sequence, where systemd is unable to properly clean up or communicate with dependent units, leading to cascading failures. This behavior could severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by preventing proper service termination, risking data corruption or incomplete state transitions during reboots. Reproducing this issue might involve simulating a rapid shutdown or inducing high system load during a reboot to stress systemd's unit management. Mitigation steps include reviewing systemd configuration for timeout settings, ensuring proper D-Bus functionality, and applying any relevant Oracle Linux patches for systemd behavior under stress. Supporting evidence includes the broad scope of affected units in the log window, which indicates a systemic rather than isolated failure, and known issues in systemd with socket handling under certain kernel configurations as documented in upstream bug trackers.

This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, which is showing widespread communication failures across multiple services. The log window indicates repeated errors such as 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected' for a broad range of services including systemd-logind, crond, sshd, and Exadata-specific services like exachkcfg and exadata-netdiag-dump, culminating in the explicit failure of exachkcfg.service. The likely technical root cause is a systemic issue with systemd's inter-process communication, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus failure under high load or resource exhaustion, disrupting service state propagation. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability, as critical services like sshd and Exadata-specific monitoring components are unable to operate or report status correctly, potentially leading to undetected failures or degraded availability. Reproduction of this issue could likely be triggered by simulating high system load or inducing D-Bus connection timeouts during service state changes. Recommended resolution includes restarting the systemd daemon to reset communication channels, followed by checking system resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors) and D-Bus logs for underlying issues; if persistent, escalation to Oracle support for deeper analysis of systemd behavior in Exadata environments is advised. Supporting evidence includes the explicit failure state of exachkcfg.service and the pattern of transport endpoint errors, which align with known systemd issues under stress as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to storage path failures as evidenced by repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' errors across multiple disk devices (sde to sdp) with the hostbyte result 'DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST'. The likely technical root cause is a transport layer failure in the storage subsystem, potentially due to a SAN connectivity issue, faulty hardware, or a driver-level timeout under heavy I/O load, leading to multipath path failures as seen in the log window with repeated 'Failing path' messages. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as these errors indicate potential data access interruptions or complete storage path unavailability, which could degrade database performance or cause service outages. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of high I/O stress, storage network instability, or by simulating hardware faults on the affected paths. Recommended resolution steps include immediate checks on storage array connectivity, review of multipath configuration for failover policies, and inspection of hardware logs for underlying failures, followed by potential driver updates or firmware patches if a known issue is identified.

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to storage device errors and multipath path failures as evidenced by the repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' messages across multiple disk devices (sda to sdp) with the error code hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST. The root cause likely stems from a transport layer failure in the storage subsystem, possibly due to a SAN or fabric connectivity issue, a failing storage controller, or a misconfiguration in the multipath setup leading to path unavailability. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as these errors indicate potential data access issues or complete loss of redundancy in storage paths, risking data integrity or availability during I/O operations. This behavior could be reproduced by simulating a storage network interruption or inducing a controller failure during high I/O workload, which would trigger similar cache synchronization failures. Recommended resolution includes immediate validation of the storage fabric, checking multipathd configuration for correct failover policies, and inspecting hardware logs for controller or disk issues, followed by potential path reinstatement or hardware replacement if faults are confirmed.

This behavior could be reproduced by intentionally misconfiguring network interfaces or by having multiple services attempting to bind to the same IP-port combination. To resolve this, I recommend verifying the network configuration on the host scaqae03celadm07.us.oracle.com, ensuring the IPs are correctly assigned, and checking for conflicting services using tools like netstat or ss. Supporting evidence comes from common SSH binding issues in distributed systems, often tied to incorrect /etc/hosts or interface settings, which are well-documented in Oracle and Linux networking contexts.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting repeated failures to send unit remove signals across multiple services and targets, including Exadata-specific ones like exadata.target and precell-zero.service. The consistent error 'Transport endpoint is not connected' in the log window suggests a breakdown in systemd's communication mechanism, likely due to a socket or bus disconnection, which could stem from a system crash, abrupt shutdown, or underlying kernel issue affecting the D-Bus or systemd's internal state. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability, as it indicates that systemd is unable to properly manage or clean up service states, potentially leading to orphaned processes or incomplete shutdowns that could disrupt database or storage cell operations. Reproduction of this issue might involve simulating a forced system halt or inducing D-Bus failures during high load to observe if systemd loses connectivity. Mitigation steps include restarting the systemd daemon if possible, checking for kernel panics or D-Bus errors in prior logs, and verifying system resource exhaustion as a contributing factor. Supporting evidence includes the breadth of affected units in the log window, spanning network devices, disk devices, and custom Exadata services, which collectively point to a systemic failure rather than an isolated glitch, often seen in scenarios of unexpected system termination as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides.

This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, critical to the operation of Exadata/Exascale systems. The log window shows widespread communication failures with repeated 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected' errors across numerous services, indicating a systemic issue with systemd's ability to manage and communicate with units. The likely technical root cause is a failure in the D-Bus communication layer or a systemd crash/restart that left sockets or endpoints in an inconsistent state, disrupting service management. This behavior severely impacts Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as essential services like sshd, dbus, rsyslog, and Exadata-specific components (e.g., exadata-netdiag-dump, exadata-dbproc-bind) are unable to receive state change signals, potentially leading to service outages or unresponsiveness. Reproduction could likely be triggered by inducing a systemd crash or network socket failure during high load or a forced reboot scenario. Recommended resolution includes restarting systemd or the affected host to reset communication channels, followed by a detailed review of systemd journal logs for preceding errors and ensuring the latest systemd patches are applied to mitigate known bugs.

The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the systemd-networkd.socket unit, which is responsible for managing network configurations in a Linux environment, including Oracle Exadata systems. The error message indicates a failure to queue the service startup job, likely due to a missing or misconfigured service file, compounded by a 'transaction is destructive' state, suggesting a broader issue with systemd's ability to manage dependent services. This failure can lead to significant impact on network availability, potentially disrupting communication between Exadata components or external systems, which is critical for database and cluster operations. The issue could likely be reproduced by intentionally corrupting or removing the systemd-networkd.socket configuration file and restarting the systemd daemon. To resolve this, immediate steps should include verifying the presence and integrity of the systemd-networkd.socket file, checking for recent system updates or manual changes that might have caused the misconfiguration, and restarting the systemd-networkd service after correction. Supporting evidence comes from known systemd behaviors where missing unit files or destructive transactions often result in failed states, as documented in official systemd resources and Oracle Linux guides.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/ - Oracle Linux systemd configurations;https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/ - Red Hat systemd troubleshooting;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/systemd.socket.5.html - systemd.socket man page", "log_window": "systemd: systemd-networkd.socket failed to queue service startup job (Maybe the service file is missing or not a non-template unit?): Transaction is destructive.\nsystemd: Unit systemd-networkd.socket entered failed state.", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 28, "message_structure": "systemd: systemd-networkd.socket failed to queue service startup job (maybe the service file is missing or not a non-template unit?): transaction is destructive.\nsystemd: unit systemd-networkd.socket entered failed state.", "k0_sim": 0.5797488689422607, "i0_sim": 0.6100574135780334}
{"incident_id": "137f76cdd8c1", "host": "scaqai03adm05", "component": "systemd", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.85, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, which is fundamental to system initialization and service management on Oracle Linux systems used in Exadata/Exascale environments. The extensive log entries showing 'Failed to send unit remove signal' with errors like 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected' across a vast array of services and devices indicate a severe communication breakdown within systemd's control mechanisms. The likely technical root cause is a failure in the systemd inter-process communication, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus issue during a system shutdown or reboot sequence, leading to incomplete cleanup of unit states. This behavior could significantly impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by preventing proper service termination or initialization, potentially causing orphaned processes or resource contention during subsequent boots. Reproduction of this issue might occur under stress conditions like abrupt power loss, forced reboots, or during heavy I/O operations that disrupt systemd's ability to manage units. Recommended resolution steps include checking for systemd version compatibility with the Oracle Linux kernel, reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors, and ensuring no underlying hardware or network issues (like RDMA/IB failures) are disrupting communication. Supporting evidence comes from known systemd issues in high-availability systems where socket errors during shutdown can cascade into broader system instability, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux knowledge bases. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

{"incident_id": "1dd1cb1b111b", "host": "scaqai03dv0501m", "component": "kernel", "label": 1, "confidence": 0.9, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to SCSI disk synchronization and device-mapper multipath failures as seen in the log window. The repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' errors with 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' across multiple disk devices (sda, sdc, sdf, etc.) indicate a severe transport layer issue, likely due to a SAN or storage connectivity failure, hardware fault, or firmware incompatibility. Additionally, the device-mapper multipath messages about failing paths (e.g., 8:32, 8:176) suggest that the system is actively marking storage paths as failed, which could lead to data unavailability or degraded performance. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as this could disrupt database access or cause node eviction in a clustered environment if storage access is not restored. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating a storage network interruption or inducing a hardware failure on the affected paths. Recommended resolution includes immediate checks on storage connectivity, HBA status, and multipath configuration, alongside reviewing kernel logs for preceding errors and engaging storage vendor support if hardware issues are suspected. Supporting evidence comes from known kernel behaviors under transport failures, often documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat storage troubleshooting guides, where DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST typically points to underlying fabric or hardware issues.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/uek/", "additional_sources":

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where two services, chrony-wait.service and rc-oracle-exadata.service, have failed with distinct error results 'exit-code' and 'signal' respectively. The failure of chrony-wait.service suggests a potential issue with time synchronization, which is critical for distributed systems like Exadata where consistent timing across nodes is essential for operations such as clustering and logging accuracy. The failure of rc-oracle-exadata.service, which appears to be a custom service likely tied to Exadata-specific initialization, indicates a deeper issue in the system bootstrap or configuration specific to Oracle's engineered systems, potentially disrupting database or grid infrastructure startup. These failures together pose a significant risk to system reliability and availability, as they could prevent proper initialization of key Exadata components or lead to desynchronization in a cluster environment. Reproduction of this issue might involve examining the systemd service definitions for dependencies or misconfigurations, or simulating a system boot to observe if these failures recur under specific conditions like network unavailability or incorrect chrony configurations. Recommended resolution steps include inspecting the systemd journal for detailed error messages related to these services using 'journalctl -u chrony-wait.service' and 'journalctl -u rc-oracle-exadata.service', verifying chrony configuration files for correctness, and ensuring that Exadata-specific initialization scripts are properly set up.

This incident involves systemd and indicates a severe issue with multiple dependency failures during system boot or initialization, affecting critical mount points and swap configurations. The log window shows repeated failures for mounts like /var/log/audit, /crashfiles, /tmp, and swap, with specific jobs timing out or failing due to dependency issues, pointing to a likely misconfiguration or unavailability of labeled disk devices.
