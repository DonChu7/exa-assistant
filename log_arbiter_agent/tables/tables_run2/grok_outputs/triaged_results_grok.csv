The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the systemd-logind.service, which is essential for managing user logins and sessions in an Oracle Linux environment. The failure of this service with a 'timeout' result, as seen in the log window, suggests a potential issue with system initialization or resource availability that prevents the login service from starting within the expected timeframe. This failure can severely impact system usability, as it may prevent users from logging in, thereby affecting overall system availability on an Exadata or Exascale platform. The root cause could be related to underlying resource constraints, misconfigurations in systemd, or dependencies failing to start properly. Reproducing this issue might involve simulating high system load or intentionally delaying dependent services to trigger a timeout during boot. The recommended resolution is to investigate the systemd configuration, check for resource bottlenecks, and review journalctl logs for preceding errors related to systemd-logind dependencies. Supporting evidence for criticality comes from systemd documentation and known issues in Oracle Linux environments where login service failures disrupt operational workflows.

The incident involves the exachkcfg component on an Exadata system, where an SSH daemon error is reported due to a failure to bind to port 22 on a specific IP address, as seen in the log window. The likely technical root cause is a misconfiguration or unavailability of the IP address 10.32.238.108 on the host, possibly due to a network interface not being properly configured or the IP being already in use elsewhere. This issue is unlikely to have a significant impact on Exadata reliability or availability, as it pertains to SSH access on a specific interface, which may not be critical for core database or storage operations. Reproduction of this behavior could occur by attempting to start or restart the SSH service when the specified IP is not assigned to any active network interface on the host. The recommended resolution is to verify the network configuration on the host scacad02adm14.us.oracle.com, ensuring the IP address is correctly assigned to an interface, and restarting the SSH service if necessary. Supporting evidence for this assessment includes common SSH binding errors documented in Oracle Linux and Exadata networking contexts, where such errors are typically transient or configuration-related rather than indicative of a systemic failure. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

The incident involves a kernel-level message related to a failure in the 'Synchronize Cache' operation for a storage device identified as 'sde'. This error, with hostbyte=DID_OK and driverbyte=DRIVER_OK, indicates that while the command failed, there was no underlying host or driver error, suggesting a transient or device-specific issue rather than a systemic failure. The likely root cause is a temporary communication glitch with the storage device or a firmware quirk on the device side, which does not typically impact overall system reliability or availability in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The potential impact on system operations is minimal, as this error does not indicate data loss or persistent storage failure, and the system can likely retry or bypass the operation without consequence. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating heavy I/O load or intentional device interruptions, though it is often sporadic and hardware-dependent. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence and, if persistent, check the specific device's health using tools like smartctl or vendor diagnostics to rule out hardware degradation. Supporting evidence from kernel documentation and community discussions suggests that such errors are often benign unless accompanied by other I/O failures or device timeouts, which are not present in the provided log window.

b89abf8d352b,scacad02dv1401 | scacad02dv1402,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where multiple critical mount points and services have failed to start due to dependency issues and timeouts. The log window indicates failures in mounting essential filesystems such as /tmp, swap, /crashfiles, and /var/log/audit, alongside the failure of kdump.service, which is crucial for crash recovery kernel arming. The likely technical root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or unavailability of disk devices labeled for these mount points, leading to timeouts during the boot process as systemd cannot resolve the dependencies. This situation severely impacts system reliability and availability, as missing swap space can lead to memory management issues, and failure of kdump.service prevents proper crash dump collection, hindering diagnostics of other failures. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating a scenario where the labeled disk devices are unavailable or incorrectly configured in /etc/fstab or systemd unit files during boot. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the disk labels and device availability using 'blkid' and 'lsblk', checking /etc/fstab for correct entries, and ensuring that systemd units are properly configured with appropriate timeout values or dependencies. Supporting evidence for criticality comes from known systemd behavior where dependency failures cascade and halt critical system initialization, often documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux troubleshooting guides for boot failures.

The incident involves the nm-dispatcher component, which is part of NetworkManager and responsible for executing dispatcher scripts during network state changes in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The log indicates that the script '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip' was killed by signal 10 (SIGUSR1), suggesting an abrupt termination possibly due to a timeout, misconfiguration, or an underlying issue with the RDMA IP monitoring logic. This failure could disrupt RDMA network initialization or state management, potentially leading to connectivity issues or degraded performance in the Exadata fabric, which relies heavily on RDMA for high-speed interconnects. Such behavior might be reproduced by simulating network state changes (e.g., interface up/down events) while monitoring the execution of dispatcher scripts under load or with intentional script delays. The recommended resolution is to inspect the '99-rdmaip' script for errors or excessive execution time, verify NetworkManager configuration, and check for related RDMA stack errors in /var/log/messages or dmesg. This issue aligns with known NetworkManager dispatcher failures under specific conditions as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where script timeouts or signal interruptions during network events can cause cascading network service issues.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is essential for managing multiple paths to storage devices in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The repeated log entries indicating 'failing' states for multiple disk paths (sdg, sdj, sdl, etc.) with state 2 and dmstate 2 suggest a serious issue with path availability or synchronization, likely due to underlying storage connectivity problems or misconfiguration in the multipath setup. Such failures can lead to significant impact on system reliability and availability, potentially causing data access interruptions or degraded performance in a high-availability system like Exadata. This behavior could be reproduced by simulating path failures or disconnecting storage links, which would trigger similar multipathd state changes. The recommended resolution includes immediate checking of storage connectivity, reviewing multipath configuration files for errors, and verifying the health of underlying storage devices or SAN connections.

e08f05ffe1e3,scacad03adm14,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd failing to deactivate multiple swap devices during a system operation, likely a shutdown or service restart, as evidenced by the repeated 'Failed deactivating swap' messages across various device paths in the log window. The component in focus is systemd, which is critical for managing system services and resources like swap spaces in an Oracle Linux environment, often used in Exadata systems. The likely root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or failure in the logical volume management (LVM) setup for the swap devices, or a potential issue with device-mapper not releasing the resources properly, leading to the 'exit-code' failure result. This behavior could impact system reliability by preventing proper resource cleanup, potentially causing memory management issues or system hangs during reboots or service transitions, which are critical in high-availability Exadata environments. Reproduction of this issue might be achieved by simulating a system shutdown or swap deactivation command under similar LVM configurations to observe if systemd consistently fails to release the swap devices. As a resolution, I recommend checking the LVM configuration for errors, ensuring that swap devices are not in use or locked by other processes, and verifying systemd's unit files for swap management for any misconfigurations; if necessary, manually deactivate swap using 'swapoff' commands before system operations. Supporting evidence includes the consistent failure pattern across multiple device identifiers in the logs, which aligns with known systemd behaviors under resource contention or misconfiguration scenarios as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd resources.

The error message indicates a failure to disable swap on /dev/dm-2 with the reason 'Invalid argument,' which typically suggests that the device is not a valid swap area, is already disabled, or there is a misconfiguration in the system setup. This issue is unlikely to impact Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability directly, as swap space management is often a secondary concern in high-performance environments where swap usage is minimized. The behavior could be reproduced by attempting to run 'swapoff' on a device that is not configured as swap or is in an inconsistent state, possibly due to prior manual intervention or script errors. To resolve this, verify the swap configuration using 'swapon --show' and ensure that /dev/dm-2 is correctly set up as a swap device; if not needed, remove it from /etc/fstab or relevant scripts. This assessment is supported by general Linux system administration knowledge and kernel documentation on swap management, where such errors are often benign unless swap is critical to the workload.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where multiple mount points and services critical to system operation have failed to start due to dependency issues and timeouts. The root cause appears to be the failure of device units (e.g., dev-disk-by-label-TMP.device, dev-disk-by-label-KDUMP.device) to become available within the expected timeframe, likely due to underlying storage or disk label issues, misconfiguration, or hardware delays. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant as critical system paths like /tmp, /crashfiles, /var/log/audit, and swap are unavailable, which can prevent proper system operation, logging, and crash recovery mechanisms like kdump from functioning, potentially leading to data loss or unrecoverable states during failures. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage subsystem delay or misconfiguring disk labels in fstab or systemd mount units, especially under high load or during boot. The recommended resolution is to investigate the storage subsystem for latency or failures, verify disk labels and UUIDs in /etc/fstab against actual device mappings, and check systemd timeout configurations for mount and device units to ensure they accommodate hardware delays. Supporting evidence includes the consistent 'timeout' results in the log for device units and the cascading dependency failures, which align with known systemd behaviors when underlying storage is unresponsive, as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd upstream resources.

This behavior suggests a systemic failure in the storage multipathing layer, potentially due to a hardware issue with the storage array, a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, or a failure in the underlying SAN fabric connectivity. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the loss of multiple paths can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical storage resources, risking data availability and system stability. This issue could likely be reproduced by simulating a SAN outage or disconnecting multiple paths to the storage devices, which would trigger similar failure markings in multipathd.

c25d4a9a1554,scacad03dv1402,multipathd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing device mapper multipath configurations for storage redundancy and failover in Exadata/Exascale environments. The repeated log entries indicating 'failing' states for multiple disk paths (sdh, sdk, sdm, etc.) with consistent state and dmstate values of 2 suggest a severe issue with path availability or synchronization, likely due to underlying storage connectivity loss, misconfiguration, or hardware failure. This behavior poses a significant risk to system reliability and availability, as multipathd failing to manage paths can lead to I/O errors or complete storage inaccessibility, potentially causing data unavailability or service outages. Reproduction of this issue could likely be triggered by simulating storage path failures or disconnecting physical connections to the affected devices, though exact conditions may depend on the specific storage array or SAN configuration. Recommended resolution includes immediate checks on storage connectivity, validation of multipath.conf settings for failover policies, and inspection of hardware logs for disk or controller failures, followed by reinstatement of failed paths or replacement of faulty hardware if confirmed. Supporting evidence comes from known multipathd behavior in Oracle Linux and Red Hat documentation, where state 2 often correlates with a 'failed' or 'unusable' path status, frequently linked to SAN issues or zoning problems in enterprise storage setups.

The incident involves the nm-dispatcher component, which is part of NetworkManager and responsible for executing scripts during network interface state changes. The log indicates that a script '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip' was killed by signal 10 (SIGUSR1) during a 'down' operation for interface eth5.203, suggesting an abrupt termination possibly due to a timeout or an external intervention. This failure could be rooted in a misconfiguration of the RDMA IP script or an underlying issue with the network interface handling RDMA traffic, which is critical for high-performance networking in Exadata/Exascale environments. The impact on system reliability is significant as RDMA is often used for low-latency, high-throughput communication, and script failures could disrupt network connectivity or cluster operations. Reproduction of this issue might involve repeatedly bringing down the specified interface (eth5.203) while monitoring the execution of dispatcher scripts under load or with intentional delays. Recommended resolution includes reviewing the 99-rdmaip script for errors or timeouts, checking NetworkManager logs for additional context, and verifying the RDMA configuration on the affected interface. Evidence from the log message structure and the specific signal (SIGUSR1) often points to deliberate termination, which in NetworkManager contexts can be triggered by watchdog mechanisms or manual intervention, warranting deeper investigation into the script's behavior and dependencies.

The incident involves the exachkcfg component on an Exadata system, where an SSH daemon error indicates a failure to bind to port 22 on a specific IP address, as seen in the log message. This error, 'Cannot assign requested address,' typically arises due to a misconfiguration in the network settings or an IP address that is not available or assigned to the host. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal since this issue is isolated to SSH access on a specific IP and does not directly affect core database or storage services. Reproducing this behavior would involve configuring SSH to bind to an IP not associated with the host or already in use, which can be tested by modifying sshd_config and restarting the service. The recommended resolution is to verify the IP address configuration in /etc/ssh/sshd_config and ensure it matches the host's network interfaces, followed by a restart of the SSH service if necessary. Supporting evidence suggests this is a common SSH configuration issue, often seen in environments with dynamic IP assignments or manual configuration errors, and is not indicative of a deeper systemic problem in Exadata.

The error 'INIT2RTR_QP failed, status bad parameter' with an error code of -22 suggests a configuration mismatch or incompatibility in the RDMA setup, likely tied to the RDS (Reliable Datagram Sockets) over IB failing to allocate fastreg resources. This failure can severely impact Exadata/Exascale systems by disrupting high-speed interconnect communication, which is critical for database and storage node interactions, potentially leading to performance degradation or service outages. The issue could be reproduced by attempting to initialize QP under similar driver or firmware versions with mismatched parameters or unsupported configurations. Recommended resolution includes verifying the Mellanox driver and firmware versions against Oracle's compatibility matrix, checking for recent updates or patches, and reviewing kernel logs for preceding IB or RDS initialization errors. Supporting evidence comes from known issues in the Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) and Mellanox driver interactions documented in Oracle support notes, where parameter mismatches during QP transitions have caused similar failures.

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically related to a dependency failure for the /crashfiles mount point and associated device mapper issues in an Exadata environment. The likely technical root cause appears to be a timeout during the start job of the device mapper logical volume (dev-mapper-VGExaDbDomU-LVDbKdump.device), which prevents the crashfiles.mount from starting due to unmet dependencies. This could impact Exadata reliability by hindering the system's ability to properly mount critical file systems used for crash dump storage, potentially affecting diagnostic capabilities during system failures. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating a delay or failure in the initialization of the logical volume or introducing a misconfiguration in the systemd unit files related to crashfiles.mount. Given the lack of developer feedback, the exact impact and resolution steps remain uncertain, but recommended actions include verifying the configuration of the logical volume and associated systemd units, checking for underlying storage issues, and reviewing journalctl logs for additional context on the timeout.

The incident involves the systemd component, which is reporting multiple failures to unmount various directories and user runtime mounts during a shutdown or remount operation. These failures are typically seen when systemd attempts to unmount filesystems that are still in use or have lingering processes holding references to them, a common occurrence during system shutdown or service restarts in environments like Oracle Exadata where database and grid infrastructure processes may not release resources promptly. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these errors do not indicate a persistent failure or data corruption but rather a transient state during system operations. This behavior can often be reproduced by initiating a system shutdown or service restart while database or grid processes are active, especially if proper pre-shutdown scripts or checks are not in place to ensure clean termination. The recommended resolution is to ensure that Oracle database and grid services are stopped gracefully before unmount operations, potentially by adjusting systemd timeouts or dependencies via custom unit files. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from common systemd behavior documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where unmount failures are often logged but do not impact core system functionality unless associated with deeper filesystem or kernel issues, which are not evident in the provided log window.

This incident involves systemd failing to initialize critical system components, specifically the swap target and associated disk device, which subsequently causes the failure of the kdump service. The root cause appears to be a dependency issue with the swap device labeled 'SWAP', which fails to start due to a timeout as seen in the log window, indicating potential issues with disk accessibility or misconfiguration in the fstab or systemd unit files. This failure impacts system reliability by preventing swap space activation, which is essential for memory management under high load, and also disables crash recovery kernel arming via kdump, leaving the system vulnerable to unrecoverable crashes without diagnostic data. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a mislabeled or inaccessible swap partition during boot, perhaps through manual edits to /etc/fstab or by physically disconnecting the swap disk. The recommended resolution involves verifying the swap device configuration in /etc/fstab, ensuring the disk label matches the expected 'SWAP', and checking for underlying storage issues that might cause timeouts.

The incident involves the multipathd component, which manages device mapper multipath configurations for storage paths in an Exadata or similar environment. The message 'pathinfo failed after change uevent' typically indicates a transient issue where multipathd could not retrieve updated path information following a user event (uevent) for device sdb, likely due to a temporary disconnect or delay in device state propagation. This error does not generally signify a critical failure or service disruption, as multipathd is designed to handle such transient path issues by retrying or falling back to alternate paths if configured. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal unless this message appears repeatedly or in conjunction with actual path failures, which is not evident in the provided log window. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during rapid device state changes, such as hotplug events or storage reconfiguration, where uevent processing lags.

The specific error 'exit-code' suggests that the unmount operations failed due to an underlying issue, potentially related to active processes holding references to these mount points or filesystem issues during a shutdown or remount operation. This could impact system reliability by preventing proper resource cleanup, potentially leading to filesystem corruption or issues during subsequent reboots. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating a system shutdown or forced unmount while Oracle database or grid processes are active, or inducing filesystem errors on the affected mounts. Given the lack of developer feedback, the root cause remains speculative, and further triage is needed to inspect active processes, filesystem status, or related kernel messages at the time of failure. Recommended steps include checking journalctl for preceding errors, verifying if Oracle services were properly stopped, and examining fstab or mount configurations for inconsistencies.

This incident involves systemd failing to unmount several file systems during a shutdown or restart operation, as seen in the log window with repeated 'Failed unmounting' messages for paths like /var/log/audit, /u01/app, and /run/user directories. The likely technical root cause is that these mount points were busy or had open file handles at the time of unmounting, which is a common and typically transient issue during system shutdown or service restarts. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal since these failures do not indicate a persistent fault or service disruption, and the system likely continues to operate normally after the event. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during a system shutdown if processes or services are still accessing these mount points, preventing a clean unmount. The recommended resolution is to ensure proper service shutdown sequencing before unmounting, and if the issue persists, investigate for stuck processes using tools like lsof or fuser.

The incident involves the multipathd component, which manages device mapper multipath configurations for storage paths in an Exadata or similar environment. The log message 'sda: pathinfo failed after change uevent' suggests a transient issue where multipathd could not retrieve updated path information following a uevent trigger, likely due to a temporary disconnect or delay in device state propagation. This type of error typically does not indicate a critical failure or impact on overall system reliability, as multipathd is designed to handle path failures gracefully and retry operations. The potential impact on Exadata availability is minimal unless this message appears repeatedly or in conjunction with actual path loss or I/O errors, which are not evident in the provided log window. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating a device state change or temporary removal of the sda path to trigger a uevent mismatch. As a resolution, monitoring for recurrence or associated I/O errors is recommended, along with ensuring that the underlying storage configuration for sda is stable.

This behavior typically arises when systemd detects conflicting job states, such as a 'start' operation clashing with a queued 'stop' for related units like home.mount or shutdown.target, and is often a transient issue during system state transitions. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this error does not affect core database or storage services and is confined to user session management, which is not critical in a headless server context. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during a system shutdown or reboot while user sessions are active, especially if custom systemd configurations or scripts interfere with orderly unit termination.

The incident involves the nm-dispatcher component, which is part of NetworkManager responsible for executing scripts during network state changes, and the logs indicate repeated failures of RDMA-related dispatcher scripts. The likely technical root cause is a misconfiguration or bug in the custom scripts '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/100-rdmasec' and '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip', as they are failing with exit status 1 and being killed by signal 10, respectively, during connectivity changes and interface state transitions. This failure can significantly impact Exadata/Exascale reliability, as RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) is critical for high-performance networking in these systems, and script failures could disrupt network bonding (e.g., bondeth0) or RDMA initialization, leading to potential service degradation or outages. Reproducing this behavior would likely involve triggering network state changes, such as interface up/down events or connectivity checks, while monitoring the execution of these specific dispatcher scripts for errors or crashes. The recommended resolution is to review and debug the failing scripts, ensure they are compatible with the current NetworkManager version, and check for any underlying issues in the RDMA stack configuration, potentially applying patches or updates if a known bug is identified.

The incident involves the nm-dispatcher component of NetworkManager, which is responsible for executing scripts during network state changes in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The log window indicates repeated failures of custom RDMA-related scripts (100-rdmasec and 99-rdmaip) with exit status 1 and termination by signal 10, suggesting potential issues in script execution or environmental configuration related to RDMA networking. This could impact network connectivity or RDMA fabric stability, critical for Exadata performance, especially if these scripts manage IP over InfiniBand or security configurations. Reproducing this behavior might involve triggering network state changes (e.g., connectivity-change or interface up events) while monitoring script execution for errors or signals. Without developer feedback, the root cause remains uncertain—potential issues could range from script logic errors to permission issues or misconfigured RDMA dependencies. I recommend triaging this incident by inspecting the content and permissions of the failing scripts in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ and correlating with RDMA service logs for deeper insight. Supporting evidence includes the consistent failure pattern across multiple requests in the log window, which aligns with known NetworkManager dispatcher issues when scripts are incompatible with the environment or encounter runtime errors.

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to the NMI watchdog and PM-Timer functionality, which are critical for system stability and hardware monitoring. The log messages indicate a failure in creating a performance event on CPU 0 with error code -2, suggesting a potential issue with the performance monitoring unit or a conflict with other kernel modules. Additionally, the PM-Timer consistency check failure with a hexadecimal value points to a deeper hardware or firmware issue, possibly related to the system's power management or timing mechanisms, which could lead to system hangs or incorrect timekeeping. Such failures can severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by causing unexpected system behavior or crashes, especially under high load or during critical operations. Reproduction of this issue might involve stressing the system with performance monitoring tools or inducing specific power management states to trigger the PM-Timer check failure. Recommended resolution includes updating the kernel to the latest stable version from Oracle's Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel repository, checking for BIOS/firmware updates, and disabling NMI watchdog temporarily via boot parameters if the issue persists for diagnostic purposes.

This incident involves the kernel component with a specific error pattern indicating 'Guest Rx stalled' for virtual interfaces (vif), which is a significant issue in virtualized environments often tied to Xen or other hypervisor networking stacks. The likely technical root cause is a failure in the communication between the guest and host networking layers, potentially due to a misconfiguration in the virtual network setup, driver issues, or resource exhaustion on the host side. This can severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by causing network packet loss or complete stalls in guest VM communication, leading to degraded performance or service unavailability for dependent workloads. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by simulating high network load on the affected virtual interfaces or by intentionally misconfiguring the vif settings to trigger Rx queue stalls. The recommended resolution involves verifying the network configuration of the virtual interfaces, updating or reinstalling the relevant kernel modules or Xen drivers, and monitoring host resource utilization to identify contention. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from known kernel networking issues in virtualized environments, where Rx stalls are often linked to driver bugs or mismatched configurations as documented in upstream kernel and Oracle UEK contexts.

The incident involves the systemd-sysctl component, which is responsible for applying kernel parameter configurations during system boot or service initialization. The log messages indicate a failure to write values to specific bridge network filter parameters in /proc/sys/net/bridge, with the error 'No such file or directory,' suggesting that the bridge module is not loaded or the kernel does not support these parameters. This issue typically arises in environments where network bridge functionality is not configured or required, and thus, the absence of these files does not impact core system operations or Exadata/Exascale-specific services. The potential impact on reliability or availability is negligible, as these parameters are related to optional network filtering features that are not critical to database or storage cell functionality. Reproduction of this behavior is straightforward by attempting to set bridge-related sysctl parameters on a system without the bridge kernel module loaded. The recommended resolution is to ignore this message unless bridge networking is explicitly required, in which case the bridge module should be loaded via kernel configuration or module insertion.

The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or absence of expected kernel parameters or hook scripts in the initramfs environment, which systemd evaluates during early boot, though this does not appear to prevent the system from booting or functioning. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these failures are typically non-fatal and related to optional or conditional boot-time checks rather than core system functionality. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by booting with a modified kernel command line lacking the expected rd.* parameters or by using an initramfs image missing the specified dracut hooks. The recommended resolution is to review the kernel command line parameters in the bootloader configuration and ensure the initramfs image is correctly built with necessary hooks, though no immediate action is required unless other boot issues are observed.

This incident involves the systemd component, where a message indicates a failure to determine peer security context due to an unavailable protocol. The likely root cause is a transient or non-essential issue related to systemd's attempt to query security context information, possibly due to missing SELinux policies or unsupported protocol configurations in the environment. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is negligible, as this error does not typically affect core system services or operational stability. Reproduction of this behavior could occur in environments where SELinux is partially configured or specific security modules are not loaded. The recommended resolution is to verify SELinux status and ensure relevant policies are applied, though no immediate action is required unless accompanied by other systemic failures. Supporting evidence suggests that such messages are often benign in systemd logs, as seen in various Oracle Linux and systemd documentation contexts where they are classified as non-impacting warnings.

This incident involves the systemd component, where repeated errors are logged about failing to load configurations for various session scopes and mount units, as well as issues with processing messages related to non-running scopes and unloaded units like initialize_vf.service. The likely technical root cause is a misconfiguration or absence of expected configuration files for transient units, which systemd attempts to manage dynamically, or a timing issue during system initialization where these units are not yet available. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors pertain to session scopes and mounts that are not critical to core system functionality or database operations. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by simulating a system boot or user session initialization with missing or incorrectly configured systemd unit files. The recommended resolution is to verify the presence and correctness of systemd configuration files for the mentioned units and ensure proper initialization sequences, potentially ignoring these messages if they do not correlate with user-reported issues. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions indicating that such errors are often benign and related to transient or non-essential units, especially when no broader system instability is observed.

c51a9906e3e6,scaqah07adm03,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager, exhibiting widespread communication failures across multiple services and units on an Exadata system. The log window shows repeated errors such as 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected' affecting critical Exadata-specific services like exadata.target, exadata-netdiag-dump.service, and exadata-dbproc-bind.service, alongside fundamental system services like dbus.service and sshd.service. The likely technical root cause appears to be a systemic failure in systemd's inter-process communication mechanism, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus failure under high load or resource exhaustion, disrupting service state propagation and job management. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata reliability and availability, as it prevents proper initialization and management of essential services, potentially leading to system instability or partial unavailability. Reproduction could likely be triggered by simulating high system load or inducing D-Bus connection failures during boot or service restarts. Recommended resolution includes immediate investigation into systemd logs and D-Bus status, checking for resource limits or misconfigurations in systemd's runtime environment, and potentially restarting affected services or the system if safe. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected services and the critical nature of errors in a managed Exadata environment, where such systemic issues often correlate with broader operational failures based on historical systemd behavior in Oracle Linux contexts. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the failure of systemd-networkd.socket, which is responsible for managing network configurations through systemd-networkd. The log messages indicate multiple issues, including the inability to determine peer security context due to protocol unavailability and failure to load configuration for usr.mount, suggesting potential misconfiguration or missing critical files. The most severe issue is the failure of systemd-networkd.socket to queue service startup, transitioning to a failed state, which likely disrupts network service initialization and connectivity. This can significantly impact Exadata/Exascale system reliability by preventing proper network communication, critical for distributed operations and cluster management. Reproducing this behavior could involve intentionally misconfiguring or removing the systemd-networkd service files or dependencies on a test system to observe similar failures. Recommended resolution includes verifying the presence and correctness of systemd-networkd configuration files, ensuring proper SELinux or security module configurations, and restarting the systemd-networkd.socket unit after corrections. Supporting evidence aligns with known systemd issues where missing or corrupt service files lead to startup failures, as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides and Oracle Linux resources.

The likely technical root cause appears to be a systemic communication breakdown within systemd, as evidenced by repeated 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' errors, potentially triggered by a socket or IPC failure during a system shutdown or reboot sequence. This behavior severely impacts Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as it indicates that systemd is unable to properly manage service states, which could lead to improper resource cleanup, stalled shutdowns, or failure to transition system states, affecting database and grid infrastructure operations. Reproduction of this issue might occur during system shutdown or reboot under high load or when systemd's internal state is corrupted, possibly due to a race condition or resource exhaustion. Recommended resolution steps include analyzing journalctl logs for preceding errors, verifying systemd version and known bugs in the deployed Oracle Linux release, applying any relevant patches, and potentially restarting systemd or rebooting the system with monitoring to capture additional context. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected services and targets, including network, storage, and RDMA components, which collectively suggest a critical failure rather than an isolated issue, consistent with known systemd behaviors under stress or misconfiguration as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

78f36f00f9db,scaqah07adm03 | scaqae03adm05 | scaqai03adm05,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. The incident involves systemd and specifically references failures in condition checks for kernel command line parameters related to dracut-pre-udev.service. These messages indicate that certain expected kernel command line options (rd.driver.post, rd.driver.pre, rd.driver.blacklist, and rd.break=pre-udev) are not set, causing the conditional checks to fail for this service. However, these failures are typically non-impacting as dracut-pre-udev.service is part of the early boot process and such condition failures do not necessarily prevent the system from booting or functioning correctly unless explicitly required by the system configuration. The likely root cause is a mismatch between the expected kernel parameters in the systemd service configuration and the actual kernel command line provided during boot, which could stem from a default or customized bootloader configuration. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these parameters are often optional debugging or driver control flags for dracut, and core system functionality is unlikely to be affected. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting the system with a kernel command line that omits these specific rd.* parameters while having a systemd service configuration expecting them. The recommended resolution is to review the bootloader configuration (e.g., GRUB) to ensure alignment with systemd expectations if these parameters are needed; otherwise, these messages can be safely ignored. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions indicating that such condition failures are often informational and context-dependent rather than indicative of a critical issue.

This incident involves systemd and reflects multiple condition check failures during the boot process, specifically related to dracut services and kernel command line parameters. The root cause appears to be missing or misconfigured kernel command line options (e.g., rd.break) and absent hook scripts in the dracut initqueue directories, alongside failed configuration loads for sys.mount and sys-kernel.mount due to missing files. These errors are typically non-impacting as they occur during early boot stages and relate to optional or conditional services that do not prevent system functionality or stability in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The impact on reliability or availability is minimal since core systemd services and critical Exadata components are unaffected by these specific failures. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by booting a system with an incomplete or customized dracut configuration or missing kernel parameters. The recommended resolution is to review and update the kernel command line in the bootloader configuration if these services are required, though no immediate action is necessary for operational stability. Supporting evidence includes the nature of the failed conditions, which are common in customized or minimal boot environments and are well-documented in systemd and dracut troubleshooting guides as non-critical unless tied to specific dependencies.

The incident involves the systemd component, where errors are reported regarding the failure to load configuration for higgs-compute-agent-reset-bridges.service and process messages for trace-cmd.service due to missing files or units. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or absence of the specified service files, which are not standard systemd units and may relate to a custom or third-party application not critical to core system functionality. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors do not affect essential system services or hardware components. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by attempting to manage or query non-existent or improperly configured systemd units. The recommended resolution is to verify the presence and correctness of the mentioned service files or remove references to them if they are obsolete or unnecessary.

This incident involves the systemd component, where configuration files for specific services and scopes, namely higgs-compute-agent-reset-bridges.service and session-84.scope, are reported as missing. The likely root cause is that these units were referenced or attempted to be loaded by systemd, but their configuration files are either deleted, not installed, or incorrectly named, which is a common issue during system updates or manual configuration changes. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as these specific services and scopes do not seem to be core to the system's operational integrity, and the repeated log entries for session-84.scope suggest a transient or non-persistent issue. Reproducing this behavior would involve intentionally removing or misconfiguring systemd unit files for non-critical services and observing systemd's failure to load them during a restart or reload operation. The recommended resolution is to verify if these units are required; if not, suppress the warnings by masking the units using 'systemctl mask', or restore the missing configuration files if they are part of a necessary package.

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically related to the sshd-keygen.service, where the service failed to start due to missing SSH host key files as indicated by the ConditionFileNotEmpty checks failing for multiple key types (ed25519, ecdsa, rsa). The likely root cause is that the SSH host keys are not present in the expected /etc/ssh/ directory, which could occur during initial system setup or after a configuration reset, preventing the sshd-keygen.service from generating or verifying these keys. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal since this service is not directly tied to core database or storage operations, and SSH functionality can often be manually restored by generating the keys. This behavior can likely be reproduced by removing or not configuring SSH host keys on a fresh system installation and attempting to start the sshd-keygen.service.

This incident involves systemd failing to load configuration for a specific session scope (session-253.scope) and subsequently failing to process a message to abandon the scope due to it not running. The component in focus is systemd, which manages system services and user sessions, and the error pertains to a transient or non-existent user session scope, likely tied to a terminated or improperly cleaned-up user session. The root cause appears to be a benign issue where systemd cannot find or access the configuration for a session that no longer exists, which is a common occurrence during session cleanup or after abrupt terminations. This behavior does not impact overall system reliability or availability in an Exadata/Exascale environment, as it is isolated to user session management and does not affect core database or storage services. Reproduction of this issue could occur by forcefully terminating user sessions or encountering errors during session initialization, though it remains non-disruptive. No immediate resolution is required beyond routine monitoring of systemd logs for recurring patterns that might indicate a broader issue with session handling.

88134e1a24c5,scaqah07adm03,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during system initialization or operation. The likely root cause is that these configuration files were either not created, were removed, or are not required for the specific system setup, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux environments on Exadata systems. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as these messages typically occur during boot or runtime without affecting core functionality, especially since critical mounts or services like oracle-ohasd.service may not be essential in all configurations or may be managed differently. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a stripped-down systemd configuration or after a cleanup of unused unit files, which would trigger similar 'no such file or directory' errors in logs. The recommended resolution is to verify if the missing configurations are intentional or required; if not, these messages can be safely ignored, or systemd can be updated to suppress non-critical warnings. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and Oracle Linux practices, where such messages are often benign unless accompanied by actual service failures or dependency issues, which are not evident in the provided log window.

The incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during the system initialization or a systemd reload operation. The likely root cause is that these unit files are either not present on the system or are being referenced incorrectly due to a misconfiguration in the systemd presets or drop-in files, which is common in customized or minimal installations of Oracle Linux on Exadata systems. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors typically do not prevent core system functionality or critical services from starting, especially since essential mounts and services like oracle-ohasd.service are often managed separately in Exadata environments. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by performing a systemd daemon-reload or system boot on a system with missing or misconfigured unit files. As a resolution, it is recommended to review the systemd configuration and preset files to ensure only necessary units are enabled, and to suppress non-critical errors by adjusting the systemd log level if they do not impact operations. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community reports indicating that such errors are often benign unless associated with critical service failures, which are not evident in the provided log window.

8a88ea270dab,scaqah07adm03,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves systemd failing to load configuration files for several mount units related to /var and its subdirectories, as well as a connection reset error for unbound-anchor.timer. The root cause appears to be missing configuration files for the specified mount units, which are likely not critical to system operation or Exadata/Exascale functionality, as these paths are standard but not always required to be explicitly defined in systemd. The impact on system reliability or availability is minimal, as these errors do not indicate a failure of core services or dependencies, and the connection reset for unbound-anchor.timer suggests a transient communication issue rather than a systemic problem. Reproduction of this behavior could occur if systemd attempts to load mount units for non-existent or misconfigured paths during boot or service reload. The recommended resolution is to verify whether these mount units are intentionally defined or required; if not, they can be safely ignored or masked to prevent recurring log noise. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation indicating that missing configuration files for non-essential units do not typically disrupt core system functionality, and community discussions on similar errors often classify them as benign unless tied to critical services.

eebef89abc2d,scaqah07adm03,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, where a large number of configuration files for various mount points and services are reported as missing with 'No such file or directory' errors. The likely root cause is that these configuration files are either not required for the current system setup or were removed or not generated during system initialization, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux installations on Exadata systems. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as these messages typically occur during boot when systemd attempts to load configurations for non-essential or non-existent services and mount points, without evidence of actual service failure or operational disruption in the log window. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a stripped-down systemd configuration or after a system update that removes unused unit files. The recommended resolution is to verify if the missing configurations are expected in the current environment and, if not needed, suppress these warnings by masking unnecessary units via 'systemctl mask' for clarity in logs. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where such messages are often benign and tied to environment-specific configurations rather than systemic issues.

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically a failure to send a unit change signal for rsyslog.service due to a 'connection reset by peer' error. The likely technical root cause is a transient communication issue between systemd and the rsyslog service, possibly due to a temporary socket closure or resource contention, which is often benign in nature. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this error typically does not disrupt core logging functionality or system stability unless it recurs persistently. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating high system load or network interruptions to force socket closures during systemd notifications. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if isolated, no immediate action is needed beyond logging for historical reference. Supporting evidence suggests that such errors are commonly transient in systemd environments, as documented in Oracle Linux and broader Linux community resources, and do not generally indicate deeper systemic issues.

The incident involves systemd-udevd, a component responsible for managing device events and loading kernel modules during system initialization or device detection. The repeated failure to insert IPMI-related modules (ipmi_si, ipmi_devintf, ipmi_msghandler) suggests that the system is attempting to load IPMI (Intelligent Platform Management Interface) drivers, likely for hardware monitoring, but these modules are either unavailable or incompatible with the current kernel or hardware configuration. This issue is unlikely to impact core Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability, as IPMI modules are typically used for out-of-band management and not directly tied to database or storage operations. The behavior could be reproduced by triggering a device detection event or system boot on a configuration lacking IPMI support or with mismatched kernel modules. The recommended resolution is to verify if IPMI hardware is present and intended for use; if not, blacklist these modules in the systemd configuration or kernel boot parameters to suppress the errors. Supporting evidence includes the non-critical nature of IPMI for core system functions and common occurrences of such errors in environments without IPMI hardware, as documented in systemd and kernel troubleshooting contexts.

The error message 'Failed to determine peer security context: Protocol not available' suggests a minor issue related to SELinux or security context handling, likely due to a misconfiguration or unavailability of the required protocol during the update process. This error does not typically impact core system functionality or Exadata/Exascale reliability, as systemd-update-utmp is not critical to database or storage operations. The behavior could potentially be reproduced by triggering a login or session event under a system with SELinux in a non-standard configuration or missing security modules. The recommended resolution is to verify SELinux status and ensure the necessary security protocols are enabled, though this can be deferred to routine maintenance.

The incident involves the 'network' component, which is critical to Exadata/Exascale systems for communication and data transfer, but the specific error message 'failed to determine peer security context: protocol not available' suggests a transient or configuration-related issue rather than a systemic failure. This error typically arises when a network service or daemon encounters an unsupported or unavailable security protocol during peer authentication, often due to mismatched configurations or missing libraries. The impact on system reliability or availability appears minimal, as this error does not indicate a complete network failure or service disruption, and the log window shows no cascading errors or related failures. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by intentionally misconfiguring security protocols or using an outdated network service version on the system. The recommended resolution is to verify the network service configuration, ensure compatibility of security protocols between peers, and check for any missing dependencies or updates. This assessment is supported by general knowledge of network service behavior in Oracle Linux environments, where such errors are often benign unless accompanied by broader connectivity issues.

The error message 'Failed to determine peer security context: Protocol not available' typically indicates a transient or non-fatal issue related to systemd's interaction with security protocols, likely SELinux or AppArmor, which may not be fully configured or enabled in the environment. This issue is unlikely to impact the overall reliability or availability of Exadata/Exascale systems as it does not indicate a service failure or critical misconfiguration, but rather a minor incompatibility or missing protocol support during a systemctl operation. Reproduction of this behavior could likely occur by executing systemctl commands in an environment where SELinux is disabled or specific security modules are not loaded. The recommended resolution is to verify SELinux status and ensure relevant security policies are applied if needed, though this can often be safely ignored if no security violations are observed.

The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors typically do not affect core database or storage services unless directly tied to critical virtualized workloads. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by manually running the vif-bridge script under similar network conditions or with mismatched interface states.

The incident involves a kernel-level message related to ACPI and PCI configuration in an Exadata or Exascale environment, where the system fails to add MMCONFIG information and cannot access extended PCI configuration space under a specific bridge. This type of error typically arises due to firmware or BIOS limitations in handling extended PCI configuration spaces, often seen in older hardware or mismatched firmware versions, and is not necessarily indicative of an immediate operational failure. The impact on system reliability or availability is minimal as the kernel activates ISA DMA hang workarounds as a fallback mechanism, which mitigates potential issues with legacy DMA operations. Reproducing this behavior would likely involve booting the system with the same hardware and firmware configuration, potentially under specific kernel versions that expose this ACPI handling limitation. The recommended resolution is to review and update the system firmware or BIOS if updates are available, though this is not urgent unless other PCI-related issues manifest.

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically relating to storage device errors and multipath path failures as observed in the log window. The repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' errors across multiple disk devices (sda to sdp) with the hostbyte result 'DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' indicate a severe transport layer issue, likely due to a SAN or storage controller failure, or a misconfiguration in the multipath setup causing all paths to fail simultaneously. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as this behavior suggests potential data unavailability or loss of redundancy in storage access, which can lead to service outages or data integrity issues. Reproducing this issue might involve simulating a storage network disruption or inducing a controller failure to observe if the multipath daemon fails to switch paths effectively. Recommended resolution includes immediate checks on the storage array connectivity, validation of multipath configuration files for correct failover policies, and ensuring firmware compatibility between host adapters and storage controllers. Supporting evidence comes from known kernel and device-mapper behaviors under transport failure conditions, often documented in Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) release notes and Red Hat storage troubleshooting guides, where such errors are flagged as critical requiring urgent intervention.

The incident involves the rngd component, which is responsible for providing entropy to the system's random number generator, typically for cryptographic operations. The log message indicates a failure in initializing the jitter entropy source, which is often used as a fallback when hardware random number generators are unavailable or insufficient. This failure is unlikely to have a significant impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability, as modern systems often have alternative entropy sources like hardware-based random number generators (e.g., Intel RDRAND) that can compensate. The issue could potentially be reproduced by disabling hardware entropy sources or running rngd in an environment with limited CPU jitter, such as a highly loaded or virtualized system. The recommended resolution is to verify the availability of hardware entropy sources via /proc/sys/kernel/random/entropy_avail and consider reconfiguring rngd to prioritize other sources if necessary. This assessment is supported by kernel documentation and known behavior of rngd in Oracle Linux environments, where jitter initialization failures are often benign unless the system is under extreme entropy starvation, which is not indicated in the provided log window.

The incident involving the multipathd component indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths being marked as failed across different maps (mpathc and mpathb) as seen in the log window. This behavior suggests a potential underlying problem with the storage subsystem, possibly due to a hardware failure, misconfiguration of the multipath setup, or connectivity issues with the storage array. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the failure of multiple paths can lead to reduced redundancy, potential data unavailability, or performance degradation if the system cannot failover to alternate paths. This issue could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage controller failure or disconnecting multiple paths to the storage array in a test environment. The recommended resolution involves immediate checking of the physical storage connections, reviewing the multipath configuration for errors, and running diagnostic tools like 'multipath -ll' to assess the state of paths, alongside engaging with storage support if hardware issues are suspected. Supporting evidence includes the consistent pattern of path failures across multiple devices as shown in the message structure, which aligns with known multipathd behavior during storage outages or misconfigurations in Oracle Linux and Red Hat documentation.

The repeated log entries indicating 'failing' states for multiple devices (sdi, sdk, sdc, sde, sdg) with consistent state and dmstate values of 2 suggest a systemic issue in path management, likely due to underlying storage connectivity loss or misconfiguration in the multipath setup. This behavior poses a significant risk to system reliability and availability, as it indicates potential inaccessibility of storage paths, which could lead to data unavailability or degraded performance in a high-availability setup. Reproduction of this issue might involve simulating storage path failures or intentionally misconfiguring multipathd settings to observe similar state transitions. Recommended resolution includes immediate validation of storage connectivity, review of multipathd configuration files for errors, and checking for firmware or driver mismatches that could cause path failures.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where multiple configuration load failures for transient scopes and mounts like session-<num>.scope, run.mount, and run-user.mount are reported, alongside conditional failures for sshd-keygen.service due to missing SSH host keys. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or absence of expected configuration files for temporary session scopes and mounts, which are often dynamically created and not critical to system stability, combined with SSH key generation conditions not being met, possibly due to a fresh installation or manual intervention. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors pertain to non-essential or transient units and do not indicate a broader systemd failure or service disruption, with sshd.service likely still operational if keys exist elsewhere. Reproduction of this behavior could occur by removing or not generating SSH host keys and triggering systemd to start related services, or by initiating user sessions without pre-configured scope files. Resolution involves verifying the presence of SSH host keys in /etc/ssh/ and regenerating them if necessary using ssh-keygen, while the scope and mount errors can likely be ignored unless associated with specific user session issues.

Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from systemd documentation and common troubleshooting practices for missing service files, which typically classify such errors as non-critical unless tied to essential system services.

This incident involves the systemd component, where the logs indicate failures related to loading configuration and sending signals for a transient service unit, specifically run-389621.service. The errors 'No such file or directory' and 'Connection reset by peer' suggest that the service file is either missing or was removed during runtime, which is typical for temporary or dynamically created run- units that are no longer needed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as these errors do not indicate a persistent failure in core systemd functionality or critical system services. Reproduction of this behavior could occur if a temporary service is initiated and then abruptly terminated or if its configuration is deleted mid-operation, which is often seen in scripted or automated environments. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if this pattern repeats with critical services, further investigation into service management scripts or systemd configuration may be necessary. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation, which notes that transient units can fail with such errors without systemic impact, and community discussions on similar non-critical errors reinforce this assessment.

This incident involves systemd and specifically relates to the sshd-keygen.service failing to start due to missing SSH host key files as indicated by the ConditionFileNotEmpty checks in the log window. The root cause appears to be a configuration or initialization issue where the expected SSH host keys (/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key, /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key) are not present, preventing the service from starting. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal since this does not affect core database or storage operations, though it may prevent SSH access if not resolved. Reproduction of this behavior is straightforward by ensuring the SSH host key files are absent or empty during system boot or service initialization. The recommended resolution is to manually generate the missing SSH host keys using ssh-keygen or ensure they are properly provisioned during system setup. Supporting evidence comes from standard systemd behavior where conditional checks prevent service startup without impacting broader system stability, and this is a common issue in Linux environments during initial configuration.

The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this error does not suggest a persistent failure of the mrdiag.service or broader system instability. Reproduction of this behavior could likely occur under conditions of high system load or during rapid service state changes, though it remains an edge case. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if it persists, journalctl logs for mrdiag.service should be reviewed for underlying issues.

The incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Linux environments, including Oracle Exadata systems. The log messages indicate failures to load configurations for temporary mount units like run.mount and run-user.mount, as well as session scopes such as session-233.scope, with errors stating 'No such file or directory' and inability to abandon non-running scopes. These errors typically arise from missing or misconfigured unit files for transient or user-specific scopes, which are often created dynamically and may not persist across reboots or sessions. The likely root cause is benign, stemming from systemd attempting to manage units that have been cleaned up or never properly initialized, which does not indicate a systemic failure or misconfiguration requiring immediate intervention. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal, as these units are not critical to core database or storage operations. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during user session terminations or system cleanup processes where temporary units are removed before systemd can process related messages. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence or associated user session issues, but no immediate action is required beyond logging for future reference. Supporting evidence aligns with known systemd behavior documented in official resources, where such errors are often transient and non-impacting unless paired with broader service failures.

This incident involves systemd failing to load configurations for multiple mount units related to 'var' and 'var-www' directories, as well as an error processing a message for the 'initialize_vf.service' unit which is not loaded. The root cause appears to be missing configuration files for these mount units, likely due to a misconfiguration or incomplete setup during system initialization, rather than a systemic failure. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these specific mount points (e.g., var-www-html-yum-unknown-EXADATA-dbserver.mount) are not critical to core database or storage operations and likely pertain to optional or custom configurations. Reproduction of this behavior could occur by intentionally omitting or misconfiguring mount unit files in the systemd configuration directory, or by referencing non-existent services like initialize_vf.service. Resolution steps include verifying the existence of the mentioned unit files in /etc/systemd/system or /lib/systemd/system and correcting or removing references to non-critical or unnecessary mounts if they are not required for the system's operation. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation indicating that such errors are typically non-fatal and do not prevent the system from booting or functioning, unless the missing units are dependencies for critical services, which does not appear to be the case here based on the log context.

This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous log entries indicate a failure to load configurations for various mount points and services, including firewalld.service, ohasd.service, and multiple disk and directory mounts. The likely root cause is that these configuration files are either missing, incorrectly named, or not required for the current system setup, which is a common scenario during system initialization or after custom configurations in environments like Oracle Exadata where not all standard services are deployed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors do not indicate active service failures or operational disruptions but rather systemd's inability to locate expected configuration files, many of which may not be relevant to the system's current role or setup. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a minimal or customized set of systemd unit files, or after a system update that removes or renames certain configurations. The recommended resolution is to review the systemd configuration and suppress these warnings by disabling unnecessary units or creating placeholder configurations if needed, ensuring logs remain clean for actual issues. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions indicating that such errors are often benign during early boot phases or in specialized environments like Oracle Linux deployments.

02c114ad78c8,scaqah07adm04,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves systemd failing to load configurations for a large number of mount points and services, as evidenced by the repeated 'No such file or directory' errors in the log window. The likely technical root cause is a misconfiguration or incomplete setup during system initialization, where systemd is attempting to load unit files that are either missing or not properly defined in the system configuration. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors are typically non-fatal and do not indicate an active failure of critical components or services; they often occur during boot when certain expected configurations are absent but not required for core functionality. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting the system with an incomplete or altered set of systemd unit files, potentially after a system update or manual configuration change. The recommended resolution is to review the systemd configuration files in /etc/systemd/ or /usr/lib/systemd/ to ensure all referenced units are present, and if not needed, to mask or disable them to prevent these warnings. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where such errors are often logged during boot but do not impede system operation unless tied to a critical service failure, which is not apparent here.

7e380b589164,scaqah07adm04,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, specifically a failure to send a unit change signal for crond.service due to a 'Connection reset by peer' error. The likely technical root cause is a transient communication issue between systemd and the crond.service, possibly due to a temporary socket closure or network interruption, which is not uncommon in distributed systems under load. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this error typically does not affect the core functionality of crond.service or systemd itself, and crond tasks are likely to continue running unaffected. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating high system load or network disruptions while systemd attempts to communicate with dependent services. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if the issue persists, restarting systemd or investigating socket configurations may be warranted. Supporting evidence suggests that such errors are often transient and benign in systemd environments, as documented in various Linux system administration resources.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, reporting multiple 'failed to load configuration' errors for various mount points and services during system boot or initialization. The likely root cause is that these configuration files or units are either missing, not installed, or not required for the specific system configuration, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux environments on Exadata systems where not all systemd units are needed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as these messages typically do not indicate a failure of critical system components or services but rather an attempt by systemd to load optional or non-existent configurations. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting a system with a similar minimal or customized systemd configuration where certain unit files are absent. The recommended resolution is to ignore these messages unless they correlate with actual service failures or system instability, and if necessary, verify the systemd configuration for missing or misconfigured units using 'systemctl' commands. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where such messages are often benign during boot when optional services or mounts are not defined.

36591c00b847,scaqah07adm04,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. The incident involves the systemd component, where numerous log entries indicate a failure to load configuration files for various mount points and services due to 'No such file or directory' errors. This behavior is often seen during the early boot phase or in minimal environments where systemd attempts to load configurations for units that are not present or relevant to the current system setup, especially in specialized systems like Exadata. The likely root cause is the absence of expected configuration files or directories, which does not necessarily indicate a misconfiguration but rather a mismatch between systemd's default expectations and the tailored Exadata environment. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors do not point to active service failures or critical system components being affected. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting an Exadata system with a minimal or customized configuration where systemd unit files are not fully populated. As a resolution, these messages can generally be ignored unless associated with specific service failures; if needed, systemd units can be masked or customized to suppress irrelevant errors. Supporting evidence includes the repetitive nature of the 'No such file or directory' errors across a wide range of non-critical mount points and services, consistent with harmless systemd noise during initialization as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd contexts.

fa0766abb2dc,scaqah07adm04,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, specifically the systemd-binfmt.service, which is responsible for registering binary formats for execution in the kernel. The log messages indicate that the condition checks for non-empty directories at /run/binfmt.d and /usr/local/lib/binfmt.d failed, meaning these directories are either empty or do not exist, preventing the service from starting. This is not a critical issue as systemd-binfmt.service is an optional component typically used for running binaries in foreign architectures, and its absence does not impact core system functionality or Exadata/Exascale operations. The potential impact on reliability or availability is negligible since most Oracle environments do not rely on custom binary format registrations. Reproduction of this behavior is straightforward by ensuring the specified directories are empty or non-existent during system boot or service start. The recommended resolution is to ignore this message unless specific use cases require binary format support, in which case the directories should be populated with appropriate configuration files. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation, which clarifies that failing conditions like ConditionDirectoryNotEmpty result in the service being skipped without broader system impact.

The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these messages typically reflect systemd's attempt to process non-existent or misconfigured units without evidence of actual service disruption or failure in the provided log window. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by intentionally removing or misconfiguring systemd unit files and then triggering a systemctl daemon-reload or system boot. Resolution steps include verifying the presence and correctness of systemd unit files in /etc/systemd/system or /lib/systemd/system, and ensuring that any custom configurations align with the system's expected setup. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from systemd documentation and community discussions, which often classify such 'no such file or directory' errors as non-critical unless accompanied by explicit service failures or system instability.

This incident involves systemd-udevd, a device manager component responsible for handling device events and creating device nodes in the system. The log messages indicate repeated failures to open block devices under /dev/loop0 with various partition numbers, suggesting that the system is attempting to access non-existent loop device partitions. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or an outdated udev rule attempting to process loop devices that are not properly set up or have been removed. This type of error typically has minimal impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability, as loop devices are often used for temporary or testing purposes and are not critical to core database or storage operations. Reproducing this behavior could involve creating a loop device without proper partition setup and triggering udev to process it. To resolve this, administrators should review and clean up any custom udev rules or scripts referencing loop devices and ensure that loop device configurations are valid. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from systemd documentation and known behaviors in Oracle Linux environments where such errors are often benign unless tied to a specific workload.

This incident involves the kernel component with widespread failures in disk synchronization across multiple storage devices as evidenced by repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' errors with 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' and 'driverbyte=DRIVER_OK' in the log window. The likely technical root cause appears to be a transport layer failure affecting multiple paths, as indicated by the device-mapper multipath messages failing several paths repeatedly, which suggests a SAN or storage connectivity issue rather than isolated disk failures. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as this could lead to data access interruptions, potential data corruption, or complete storage unavailability if all paths fail. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of storage network instability or during high I/O load scenarios that stress the transport layer. Recommended resolution steps include immediate checks on storage network connectivity, validation of multipath configurations, and inspection of storage controller logs for related errors, followed by failover testing if feasible. Supporting evidence for this criticality comes from known kernel and device-mapper behaviors under transport failure conditions, often documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat storage troubleshooting guides, where such errors have led to service disruptions in high-availability environments.

d09626d0ea03,scaqah07adm04vm01 | scaqae03adm06vm01,multipathd,1,0.9,"Severity Assessment: Critical. The incident involving multipathd indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths being marked as failed simultaneously across several devices (sdi, sde, sdg, sdk, sdm, sdo, sda, sdc). This component, multipathd, is crucial for managing redundant paths to storage devices in an Exadata/Exascale environment, ensuring high availability and failover capabilities. The likely technical root cause appears to be a widespread storage connectivity issue, potentially due to a SAN failure, misconfiguration of the multipath setup, or a hardware issue with the storage array or interconnects. Such a failure pattern can critically impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by rendering storage inaccessible, leading to potential data unavailability or service outages for database operations. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a SAN outage or disconnecting multiple storage paths intentionally to observe multipathd's response. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of SAN connectivity, checking multipath configuration files for errors, and inspecting storage hardware logs for faults, followed by failover testing if paths are restored. Supporting evidence for this severity comes from known precedents in Oracle Exadata documentation and Red Hat multipath troubleshooting guides, where simultaneous path failures are treated as high-priority incidents requiring urgent intervention.

The incident involves the nm-dispatcher component, part of NetworkManager, which is responsible for handling network configuration scripts and events in Oracle Linux environments often used with Exadata systems. The log messages indicate a failure to determine the device type for specific network interfaces (clre0, clre1, stre0, stre1), which are likely custom or virtual interfaces possibly related to clustering or storage networks. This issue typically arises due to missing or incomplete udev rules, incorrect device naming, or unsupported interface types by NetworkManager, and does not directly imply a failure in network functionality or connectivity. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as core networking services are often managed by lower-level components or custom configurations outside NetworkManager's scope. Reproducing this behavior could involve creating or renaming network interfaces that lack proper type definitions in udev or NetworkManager configurations. The recommended resolution is to verify and update udev rules or NetworkManager configuration files to recognize these interface types, or to exclude them from NetworkManager control if they are managed by other tools. Supporting evidence suggests that such errors are common in environments with non-standard network setups and are generally benign unless accompanied by actual connectivity issues, as noted in NetworkManager documentation and community discussions.

The incident involving multipathd indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths being marked as failed across different multipath maps (mpathf, mpathh, mpathe).

The impact on system availability could be significant, as failed paths can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to storage devices if redundancy is not properly configured or if failover mechanisms fail. This issue could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage controller failure or disconnecting specific paths to observe multipathd behavior under stress. Resolution steps include immediate validation of SAN connectivity, checking multipath configuration files for errors, and reviewing storage array logs for correlated failures.

The incident involves the multipathd component, which manages device mapper multipath for storage redundancy in Exadata systems. The log message 'sdj: mark as failed' indicates that a single path to a storage device has been marked as failed, which is a common occurrence in multipath environments when a path becomes unavailable due to transient issues like cable disconnects or temporary controller unavailability. This does not necessarily imply a critical failure, as multipathd is designed to handle such events by rerouting I/O through alternate paths, ensuring continued availability. The potential impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal unless all paths to the device fail, which is not indicated in the provided log window. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating a path failure by disconnecting a storage cable or disabling a controller port, though this is not recommended in a production environment. The recommended resolution is to monitor the system for additional path failures and verify the status of the multipath configuration using 'multipath -ll' to ensure other paths are active; if the issue persists, investigate hardware or connectivity issues on the affected path. This assessment is supported by standard multipathd behavior documented in device mapper multipath guides, where single path failures are treated as non-critical events in redundant setups.

This incident involves the kernel component with a specific error in the Mellanox (mlx5_core) driver related to InfiniBand (IB) operations on an Exadata/Exascale system. The error message indicates a failure in the INIT2RTR_QP operation with a 'bad parameter' status and an associated syndrome, suggesting a misconfiguration or incompatibility in the RDMA/IB stack during queue pair initialization. This failure directly impacts the RDS/IB subsystem, as evidenced by the subsequent log entry stating 'Failed to setup fastreg resources,' which likely disrupts high-performance data transfer critical for database operations. The potential impact on system reliability is significant, as RDS over InfiniBand is essential for cluster communication in Exadata environments, potentially leading to degraded performance or node isolation. Reproduction of this issue could likely be triggered by reinitializing IB resources under similar workload conditions or with the same driver/firmware configuration. Recommended resolution includes verifying the Mellanox driver and firmware versions against Oracle's certified configurations, reviewing kernel parameters for IB/RDS, and applying any relevant patches from My Oracle Support for known issues with INIT2RTR_QP failures. Supporting evidence aligns with documented kernel and RDMA issues in Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) releases, where parameter mismatches or driver bugs have historically caused similar errors.

The incident involves the exachkcfg component on an Exadata system, where an SSH daemon error indicates a failure to bind to port 22 on a specific IP address (10.31.10.173), as seen in the log window. This error, 'Cannot assign requested address,' typically suggests a network configuration issue, IP conflict, or that the IP address is not properly assigned to the host, which is critical for Exadata administration and diagnostic tools reliant on SSH connectivity. The impact on Exadata reliability is significant since SSH access is essential for system management, monitoring, and maintenance tasks, potentially leading to administrative downtime or inability to perform critical checks. This behavior could likely be reproduced by attempting to bind SSH to an unassigned or conflicting IP address on the host, possibly after a network reconfiguration or IP reassignment. The recommended resolution is to verify the network configuration, ensure the IP address is correctly assigned to the interface, and restart the SSH service after resolving any conflicts. Supporting evidence includes the explicit error message in the log and the critical role of SSH in Exadata environments, where such failures are often linked to misconfigured network settings or post-reboot IP binding issues as noted in Oracle support documentation. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

The incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, failing to deactivate multiple swap devices during a system operation, likely a shutdown or reconfiguration sequence. The repeated failure messages across various device paths (/dev/dm-2, /dev/VGExaDb/LVDbSwap1, and associated UUIDs) indicate a systemic issue with swap deactivation, potentially tied to a misconfiguration in the logical volume manager (LVM) or device mapper settings, or a failure in underlying storage accessibility. This behavior can severely impact system reliability, as improper swap deactivation may lead to data corruption, incomplete shutdowns, or failures in system state transitions, especially in an Exadata environment where high availability is critical. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by initiating a system shutdown or swap deactivation command (e.g., 'swapoff') under similar LVM configurations or storage conditions. The recommended resolution is to investigate the LVM configuration for errors in swap volume setup, check for underlying storage device failures or latency issues, and ensure systemd's swap unit files are correctly defined. Supporting evidence includes the consistent 'exit-code' failure result across all swap deactivation attempts, which points to a non-transient error, and known systemd behavior where swap deactivation failures often correlate with storage or configuration issues as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd upstream resources.

The incident involves systemd failing to mount multiple paths under /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages for various virtual machine instances on an Exadata system, as seen in the log window with repeated 'Failed with result 'exit-code'' messages across multiple VMs. The likely technical root cause is a misconfiguration in the mount units or an underlying issue with the storage or network filesystem accessibility, potentially due to unavailable NFS shares or incorrect fstab entries. This failure impacts Exadata reliability by preventing access to critical guest image directories, which are essential for VM operations and could disrupt database or application services hosted on these VMs. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by simulating a network disconnection to the storage target or introducing an invalid mount configuration in the systemd unit files.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, failing to mount multiple remote file systems and associated device configurations under the /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages path, which appears to be critical for Exadata/Exascale virtual machine image management. The likely technical root cause is a timeout in device initialization (as seen in 'result 'timeout'' for multiple dev-exc-* devices), possibly due to underlying storage or network connectivity issues preventing the devices from becoming available within the expected timeframe. This failure cascades to dependency issues for remote-fs.target and specific mount points, ultimately impacting session initialization for the root user, which suggests a broader system initialization problem. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the inability to mount guest image file systems could disrupt virtual machine operations or database services reliant on these mounts, potentially leading to service outages. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage or network delay during system boot or by misconfiguring the fstab or systemd mount units for these paths. Recommended resolution steps include verifying network and storage connectivity to the backend providing these devices, checking systemd timeout configurations for mount and device units, and reviewing logs for preceding errors in storage or network subsystems.

This incident pertains to the exadata-initvf component, which is integral to the initialization of virtual functions in Exadata systems, likely related to network or storage configurations. The error message indicating a failure to open the device suggests a fundamental issue, possibly due to a misconfiguration, hardware fault, or driver incompatibility affecting the device's accessibility. Such a failure can significantly impact system availability, as it may prevent proper initialization of critical Exadata components, leading to degraded performance or complete service disruption. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating a device access failure during the initialization phase, perhaps by disconnecting a required hardware component or using an incompatible driver version. The recommended resolution involves verifying hardware connectivity, checking driver versions against Oracle's compatibility matrix, and reviewing system logs for preceding errors that might indicate the root cause. Supporting evidence for this assessment includes the explicit error message in the log window and the critical nature of device initialization in Exadata environments, where such failures often cascade to broader system issues. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This incident involves the dracut component, specifically an error during the installation of kernel modules in the kernel-modules-extra package. The error message 'dracut: installkernel failed in module kernel-modules-extra' typically indicates a transient or non-fatal issue during the initramfs generation process, often related to missing or incompatible kernel modules that are not critical for core system functionality. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this error does not affect the primary boot process or critical services unless specific extra modules are required for hardware support, which is not indicated in the log window. Reproducing this behavior could involve intentionally triggering an initramfs rebuild with mismatched or incomplete kernel module packages, though this is unlikely to be necessary given the non-critical nature. The recommended resolution is to verify the kernel-modules-extra package integrity and ensure compatibility with the current kernel version, potentially ignoring the error if no specific functionality is impacted. Supporting evidence suggests that such dracut errors are often benign in Oracle Linux environments unless tied to specific hardware dependencies, as noted in general system administration contexts for initramfs generation.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where multiple critical mount points and services have failed to start due to dependency issues and timeouts. The log window indicates failures in mounting essential filesystems such as /crashfiles, /tmp, /var/log/audit, and swap, alongside the failure of kdump.service, which is crucial for crash recovery kernel arming in environments like Exadata/Exascale. The likely technical root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or unavailability of disk devices labeled for these mount points, leading to systemd job timeouts as seen with 'result timeout' for multiple dev-disk-by-label entries. This behavior severely impacts system reliability and availability, as critical system components like swap and crash recovery mechanisms are non-functional, potentially leading to data loss or inability to recover from kernel panics. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating disk label mismatches or delays in disk availability during boot, perhaps due to underlying storage or multipath issues. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the disk labels and fstab configurations, checking for storage connectivity issues, and ensuring that systemd unit dependencies are correctly defined to avoid circular or unmet dependencies. Supporting evidence for this criticality comes from known systemd behaviors in Oracle Linux and Red Hat environments where timeout failures on essential mounts cascade into broader system initialization failures, often documented in enterprise support forums and kernel documentation.

This incident involves the kernel component with specific errors related to device-mapper multipath failing multiple paths and associated synchronize cache failures across numerous disk devices. The root cause likely stems from a transport layer issue as indicated by the consistent 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' error in the log window, which suggests a failure in the underlying storage connectivity or SAN fabric, potentially due to a misconfiguration, firmware issue, or hardware fault. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as the failure of multiple paths can lead to data unavailability or degraded performance in a multipath environment, risking application downtime or data integrity issues. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating a storage network disruption or inducing a failure in the multipath configuration under load conditions. Recommended resolution includes immediate checks on the storage array connectivity, validation of multipath configuration files, and review of HBA firmware versions, followed by failover testing to ensure path redundancy.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The log window and message structure indicate a recurring pattern of path failures across multiple devices (e.g., sdi, sdj, sdk) in maps mpathg and mpathh, with consistent state failures (state 2, dmstate 2), suggesting a systemic issue in path availability or storage connectivity. The likely root cause appears to be a failure in the underlying storage fabric, possibly due to SAN connectivity loss, zoning issues, or faulty hardware components like HBAs or cables, which is disrupting multipath redundancy. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability, as loss of multiple paths can lead to degraded performance or complete storage unavailability for critical database operations. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a SAN outage or disconnecting specific paths to observe multipathd behavior under stress.

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to SCSI disk operations where multiple drives (sdq, sdr, sds, sdt) are reporting failures in the Synchronize Cache operation with a hostbyte result of DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST and driverbyte DRIVER_OK. The error pattern suggests a transport layer issue, likely due to a temporary disconnection or failure in the storage fabric, which could be caused by a misconfigured multipath setup, faulty cabling, or a transient issue in the storage controller. Such failures can lead to data integrity risks or potential I/O hangs, directly impacting the reliability and availability of the Exadata/Exascale system, especially if these drives are part of a critical storage grid. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating storage path failures or inducing high I/O load to stress the transport layer, though exact conditions depend on the underlying hardware and multipath configuration. Recommended resolution includes immediate validation of multipath status using 'multipath -ll', checking dmesg for related errors, inspecting physical connections, and reviewing storage controller logs for faults.

The root cause likely stems from a transport layer issue in the storage subsystem, possibly due to a SAN or multipath configuration problem, leading to the failure of multiple paths as reported by device-mapper multipath logs. Such failures can severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by causing data access interruptions or potential data integrity issues on affected paths. This behavior could potentially be reproduced under conditions of high I/O load or by simulating transport layer disruptions on the storage network. Recommended resolution steps include immediate validation of multipath configurations, checking for firmware or driver mismatches, and reviewing SAN connectivity for errors or latency spikes. Supporting evidence includes the consistent pattern of transport failures across multiple devices and paths, which aligns with known issues in kernel storage stack behavior under multipath failures as documented in Oracle Linux and kernel documentation.

3c137d18c97d,scaqaw03adm03vm08,multipathd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multiple paths to storage devices in an Exadata/Exascale environment, ensuring high availability and failover capabilities. The log window and message structure indicate a widespread failure of multiple paths across several multipath maps (mpathg, mpathh, mpathe, mpathf), with consistent 'checker failed path' errors and 'sync_map_state: failing' states, suggesting a systemic issue with path detection or underlying storage connectivity. The likely root cause could be a misconfiguration in the multipath.conf file, a failure in the underlying SAN fabric, or a hardware issue with the storage controllers or disks, leading to path unavailability. Such failures can severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by reducing redundancy and potentially causing data access interruptions or performance degradation if remaining paths become overloaded or fail. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a SAN outage or disconnecting multiple paths to the storage array during active I/O operations. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of the SAN fabric status, checking multipathd configuration for incorrect settings or blacklisted devices, and inspecting storage hardware logs for errors. Supporting evidence comes from known issues in multipathd behavior under Oracle Linux environments where path failures cascade due to improper failover policies or undetected hardware faults, often documented in Red Hat and Oracle support resources for Device Mapper Multipath.

a5a8a2dda871,scaqaw03adm04,systemd,-1,0.7,"Severity Assessment: Unclear. The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the failure of the systemd-fstab-generator with an exit status of 1, indicating an error during the processing of filesystem table configurations. This generator is responsible for creating mount units based on /etc/fstab entries during system boot, and a failure could point to misconfigurations in the fstab file, syntax errors, or unsupported options that systemd cannot parse. The potential impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is uncertain but could be significant if critical filesystems fail to mount, potentially disrupting database or grid infrastructure services reliant on those mounts. Reproduction of this issue might involve intentionally introducing an invalid entry in /etc/fstab (e.g., incorrect device path or mount options) and rebooting the system to observe if the generator fails again. Given the lack of developer feedback and specific context in the log window, it is challenging to determine if this is a one-off error or a systemic issue requiring deeper investigation. The recommended step is to inspect /etc/fstab for errors, verify mount points, and check journalctl logs for additional context on the failure. This issue aligns with known systemd behaviors where fstab parsing errors lead to generator failures, as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides, but without further evidence, it remains unclear if this impacts critical operations.

08c3e15d61c6,scaqaw03adm04,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting multiple dependency failures related to remote file systems and device configurations in an Exadata environment. The root cause appears to be a timeout in device initialization jobs for multiple VM configuration devices, as evidenced by repeated 'timeout' results in the log window for paths like dev-exc-scaqaw03adm04vmXX_cfg_*.device, which subsequently causes mount failures for /EXAVMIMAGES/GuestImages paths and impacts remote-fs.target. This behavior likely disrupts the availability of critical file systems required for Exadata VM guest images, potentially leading to service interruptions or incomplete system boots for multiple VMs. The issue could be reproduced by simulating a delay or failure in the underlying storage or network layer that systemd depends on for device detection during boot. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the storage connectivity for the affected device paths, checking for underlying hardware or network issues, and reviewing systemd unit configurations for overly strict timeout settings or missing dependencies. Supporting evidence includes the consistent pattern of 'timeout' failures across multiple device jobs and the cascading effect on mount and remote file system targets, which aligns with known systemd behavior when underlying resources are unavailable during initialization.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where multiple critical mount points and services have failed to start due to dependency issues and timeouts. The log window indicates failures in mounting essential filesystems such as /var/log/audit, /tmp, /crashfiles, and swap, alongside the failure of the kdump service, which is crucial for crash recovery in Oracle Linux environments. The likely technical root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or unavailability of disk devices labeled for these mount points, leading to timeouts in device detection as seen with 'result timeout' for multiple dev-disk-by-label entries. This behavior severely impacts Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as missing mount points like /tmp and swap can cause application failures, and the failure of kdump.service prevents proper crash dump collection for diagnostics. The issue could potentially be reproduced by simulating disk label mismatches or delays in disk availability during boot, possibly due to storage configuration errors or hardware issues. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the disk labels and fstab configurations, checking for underlying storage connectivity issues, and ensuring systemd unit files are correctly defined for dependencies. Supporting evidence includes the consistent pattern of dependency and timeout failures across multiple critical targets, which aligns with known systemd behavior when storage dependencies are unmet, as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd upstream resources.

The likely technical root cause is a transport layer issue, possibly due to a SAN or storage network disruption, misconfiguration in multipath settings, or underlying hardware/firmware issues with the storage controllers or disks, leading to the kernel marking these paths as failed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as widespread path failures can result in loss of redundancy, degraded performance, or complete unavailability of storage resources critical to database operations. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating a storage network interruption or inducing high I/O stress on the affected paths to trigger transport failures. Recommended resolution steps include immediate checks on storage network connectivity, validation of multipath configuration against Oracle best practices, and inspection of hardware logs for disk or controller errors, followed by failover testing if redundancy is still available. Supporting evidence comes from kernel documentation on DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST, which indicates a transport-level issue often tied to SAN or hardware failures, and precedents in Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) environments where such errors have led to critical storage outages if not addressed promptly.

08981b8b8f96,scaqaw03adm04vm06,kernel,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the kernel component, specifically relating to SCSI disk operations where multiple drives (sde, sdf, sdg, sdh) report failures during a Synchronize Cache operation with the error code hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST and driverbyte=DRIVER_OK. The technical root cause likely stems from a transport layer issue, possibly due to a temporary disconnection, faulty cabling, or a failure in the storage controller within the Exadata/Exascale environment, disrupting communication between the host and the storage devices. The impact on system reliability is significant as these errors can lead to data integrity issues or potential data loss if the cache cannot be synchronized properly during write operations, affecting availability of critical storage resources. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be triggered by simulating transport layer interruptions or inducing high I/O stress on the affected drives to observe cache synchronization failures. Recommended resolution includes immediate checking of physical connections, reviewing storage controller logs for related errors, and potentially reseating or replacing hardware components if a fault is confirmed; additionally, applying any relevant kernel or firmware patches for known transport issues is advised. Supporting evidence comes from kernel documentation and known SCSI transport error patterns where DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST indicates a transport protocol failure, often hardware-related, as documented in kernel source logs and Oracle Linux storage troubleshooting guides.

This incident involves the kernel component with repeated failures in the 'Synchronize Cache' operation across multiple disk devices as evidenced by the log entries showing 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' and 'driverbyte=DRIVER_OK'. The error pattern suggests a transport layer issue, likely related to a failure in the storage interconnect or a transient issue with the SCSI layer in the kernel, which is failing to complete cache synchronization commands on multiple drives. This can lead to data integrity risks or potential I/O disruptions, severely impacting Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, especially if these disks are part of a critical storage configuration like ASM or cell storage. The behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of high I/O load or during specific storage failover scenarios, potentially triggered by hardware issues or driver timeouts. Recommended resolution includes immediate checking of storage hardware status, reviewing kernel logs for preceding errors, and verifying multipath configurations to rule out path failures, followed by escalation to storage support if hardware issues are confirmed. Supporting evidence comes from known kernel SCSI layer issues documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources where 'DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' indicates a transport protocol failure often tied to hardware or firmware mismatches.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in Exadata/Exascale environments. The log window and message structure indicate multiple paths across different maps (mpathf, mpathh, mpathg) being marked as failed, with specific devices (sdq, sdi, sde, etc.) also failing, suggesting a systemic issue with storage connectivity or underlying hardware. The likely root cause could be a failure in the storage array, SAN fabric, or HBA connectivity, leading to path failures detected by the multipathd checker. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as loss of multiple paths can result in degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical storage resources. Reproduction of this issue may involve simulating storage path failures or disconnecting specific SAN connections to observe multipathd behavior under stress. Recommended resolution includes immediate validation of storage hardware, SAN fabric status, and HBA logs, followed by failover testing to ensure redundancy; if hardware issues are confirmed, replacement or reconfiguration may be necessary.

This behavior could be reproduced by simulating a path failure through physical disconnection of a storage link or inducing a fault in the multipath configuration. The recommended resolution includes immediate verification of the physical storage connections, checking for disk errors in /var/log/messages, and running 'multipath -ll' to assess the status of all paths, followed by re-enabling or replacing the failed path if necessary.

e0678d799eb3,scaqaw03adm04vm07,kernel,1,0.9,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to storage device failures as evidenced by repeated 'Synchronize Cache' failures across multiple disk devices (sde through sdt) with the error code hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST and driverbyte=DRIVER_OK. The likely technical root cause appears to be a transport layer issue, possibly due to a SAN or storage controller failure, leading to the inability to synchronize cache on multiple paths as further corroborated by the device-mapper multipath logs indicating failing paths. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as this could result in data inconsistency, potential data loss, or complete storage unavailability, disrupting database operations and service levels. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of storage network instability or hardware faults in the storage array or interconnects, such as cable issues or controller failures. Recommended resolution includes immediate checking of storage hardware health, verifying SAN connectivity, and reviewing multipath configuration for path recovery settings, followed by failover testing if necessary. Supporting evidence includes the consistent failure pattern across multiple devices and paths, which aligns with known kernel and multipath behavior during transport disruptions as documented in Oracle Linux and kernel storage troubleshooting guides.

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically relating to storage device errors and multipath path failures as observed in the log window. The repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' errors with 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' across multiple sd devices (sdm, sds, sdl, etc.) indicate a severe transport layer issue, likely due to a SAN or storage connectivity failure, hardware fault, or firmware issue affecting multiple paths. The associated device-mapper multipath logs showing 'Failing path' for numerous paths further confirm that the system is experiencing a critical loss of redundancy in storage access, which could lead to data unavailability or corruption if not addressed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as storage path failures can disrupt database operations and compromise data integrity. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating a storage controller failure, cable disconnect, or firmware mismatch in a lab environment. Recommended resolution steps include immediate checks on storage hardware, SAN fabric connectivity, and multipath configuration, alongside applying any relevant kernel or firmware patches for known transport issues. Supporting evidence comes from similar kernel error patterns documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat storage troubleshooting guides, where DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST often correlates with hardware or driver-level faults requiring urgent intervention.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in an Exadata/Exascale environment, ensuring redundancy and failover for storage paths. The log window and message structure indicate a systemic failure of multiple paths across several multipath maps (mpathf, mpathg, mpathh, mpathe), with specific paths marked as failed by the checker, suggesting a potential underlying issue with the storage connectivity or hardware. The likely technical root cause could be a failure in the storage array, SAN fabric, or HBA issues, leading to path unavailability, or a misconfiguration in the multipathd setup that fails to handle path recovery correctly. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as loss of multiple storage paths can result in degraded performance or complete data unavailability if redundancy is fully compromised. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a storage controller failure or disconnecting multiple paths in a controlled environment to observe multipathd behavior. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of storage hardware health, checking SAN fabric connectivity, reviewing multipathd configuration for errors in path prioritization or failover policies, and running diagnostic tools like 'multipath -ll' to assess current path status.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in an Exadata/Exascale environment, ensuring redundancy and failover for storage paths. The repeated log entries in the log_window, showing 'sync_map_state: failing' across multiple devices (sdj, sdi, sds, sdl, sdk, sdo, sdp, sdr, sdt, sdq) with consistent state and dmstate values of 2, indicate a failure to synchronize the state of these paths, likely due to underlying path failures or misconfigurations in the device mapper multipath setup. This behavior poses a significant risk to storage availability and reliability, as it suggests that multiple storage paths are in a failed state, potentially leading to data access issues or complete loss of redundancy. The issue could likely be reproduced by simulating path failures or introducing misconfigurations in the multipath.conf file, such as incorrect path priorities or missing blacklist entries. Recommended resolution steps include immediately checking the multipath configuration for errors, verifying the status of underlying storage devices and connections, and reviewing kernel logs for related SCSI or I/O errors that might have triggered these failures. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from known issues in device mapper multipath where state synchronization failures often correlate with hardware faults or configuration mismatches, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage administration guides. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to storage device errors and multipath path failures as evidenced by repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' messages with 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' across multiple disk devices (sde to sdt). The likely technical root cause is a transport layer failure, possibly due to a SAN connectivity issue, faulty cabling, or a failing storage controller, leading to the kernel marking these paths as failed through device-mapper multipath. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as multiple failing paths can result in data unavailability or degraded performance for critical storage operations, potentially affecting database services. This behavior could be reproduced by simulating a storage network interruption or inducing hardware faults on the affected paths during high I/O load. Recommended resolution includes immediate checks on storage network connectivity, inspection of physical cabling and hardware components, and review of multipath configuration for failover policies, alongside enabling detailed logging for further diagnostics. Supporting evidence comes from kernel documentation on SCSI error handling and known issues in multipath environments where transport failures cascade across multiple devices, often seen in high-availability systems like Exadata.

This incident involves the kernel component with widespread failures in storage device synchronization and multipath path failures as evidenced by the log window. The repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' errors across multiple disk devices (sdp, sdk, sdo, etc.) with 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' indicate a severe transport layer issue, likely due to a SAN or storage controller failure, or a misconfiguration in the multipath setup. The subsequent device-mapper multipath messages showing multiple failing paths (e.g., 8:224, 8:144) further confirm that the system is experiencing significant connectivity or hardware issues with the storage subsystem, which directly threatens data integrity and availability on an Exadata/Exascale system. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating a storage network disruption or inducing a controller failure during high I/O operations. The impact on reliability is high as these failures could lead to data loss or system downtime if not addressed immediately. Recommended resolution includes checking the storage network fabric, verifying multipath configurations, and inspecting hardware logs for controller or disk failures, followed by failover testing to ensure redundancy.

The incident involving the multipathd component indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths failing across different multipath maps, specifically mpathg and mpathh, as seen in the log window with repeated 'checker failed path' messages for various path identifiers. This behavior suggests a potential underlying problem with the storage subsystem, such as a SAN connectivity issue, faulty hardware, or misconfigured multipath settings, which could lead to data access interruptions or complete loss of redundancy in a high-availability setup like Exadata/Exascale. The impact on system reliability is significant, as failed paths in multipath configurations can result in degraded performance or outages if all paths to a device are lost, directly affecting database or application availability. This issue could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage network disruption or inducing hardware failures on the affected paths, though caution is advised in a production environment. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of SAN connectivity, inspection of hardware logs for errors, and validation of multipathd configuration files to ensure proper path policies and failover settings are in place.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in an Exadata/Exascale environment, ensuring redundancy and failover for storage paths. The repeated log entries indicating 'failing' states for multiple disk paths (sdo, sdj, sdi, sdl, sdk, sdr, sdm, sdt, sds, sdq) with consistent state and dmstate values of 2 suggest a systemic issue in path synchronization or device mapper multipath handling, likely due to underlying storage connectivity issues or misconfiguration in the multipath.conf settings. This behavior poses a significant risk to system reliability and availability, as multiple failing paths could lead to loss of redundancy or complete storage access failure, impacting database operations or other critical workloads. The issue could potentially be reproduced by simulating storage path failures or inducing network disruptions between the host and storage arrays, particularly in an Exadata context where high availability is paramount. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of physical storage connections, review of multipathd configuration for incorrect path policies or blacklisted devices, and checking for firmware or driver mismatches that might cause path state mismatches.

The likely technical root cause is a mismatch or corruption in the kernel image signature during a kexec operation, which could be due to an improperly signed kernel module or a configuration issue with Secure Boot settings. This failure can significantly impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by preventing successful kernel updates or crash recovery mechanisms, potentially leading to system instability or unavailability during critical operations. The behavior might be reproduced by attempting a kexec operation with a kernel image that lacks a valid signature or under a misconfigured UEFI Secure Boot environment. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the kernel image signature, ensuring Secure Boot is correctly configured, and re-signing the kernel if necessary using appropriate tools and certificates.

The log indicates a failure to enqueue a SYSTEMD_WANTS job for mdmonitor.service due to a destructive transaction involving systemd-poweroff.service, which suggests a conflict during system shutdown or power-off operations. The likely root cause is a timing or dependency issue in systemd's transaction handling, where a 'start' job for one service clashes with a 'stop' job in the same transaction, but this does not indicate a failure of the underlying storage or critical system functionality.

Reproducing this behavior could involve initiating a system shutdown while mdmonitor.service or related device units are in the process of starting or stopping, though it may require specific timing. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence during shutdown operations and, if persistent, adjust systemd unit dependencies or timeouts via configuration overrides to prevent transaction conflicts.

This delay is likely a configured or dynamic adjustment to prevent rapid flapping of RDMA links, ensuring stability in the network fabric. The impact on system reliability or availability appears negligible, as this is a controlled delay rather than an error or outage condition. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during network link disruptions or manual failover testing in an Exadata environment with RDMA configurations. No immediate resolution or mitigation is necessary, though monitoring for repeated or excessively long delays could be prudent to ensure optimal performance.

This incident involves systemd failures related to chrony-wait.service and a mount point /u01, both of which are essential for system initialization and operation in an Oracle Linux environment typical of Exadata systems. The failure of chrony-wait.service with a 'timeout' result suggests that the system clock synchronization process did not complete within the expected timeframe, which could lead to time-sensitive operations failing, including database transactions or cluster synchronization in an Exadata setup. Additionally, the failure to mount /u01 with an 'exit-code' result indicates a potential issue with storage accessibility or configuration, which is critical as /u01 often hosts Oracle software or data files critical to database operations. The impact on Exadata reliability could be severe, as clock desynchronization might disrupt RAC or Grid Infrastructure components, while mount failures could prevent access to essential Oracle binaries or data. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a network issue preventing NTP/chrony synchronization or by introducing a misconfiguration in the fstab or storage setup for /u01.

The likely root cause could be a failure in the underlying storage hardware, a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, or a SAN fabric issue leading to path unavailability. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata reliability and availability, as multipath failures can result in data access interruptions or complete storage outages if redundant paths are exhausted. Reproduction of this issue might involve simulating storage path failures or disconnecting specific LUNs to observe multipathd behavior under stress. Recommended resolution includes immediate validation of storage hardware status, checking multipath configuration files for errors, and reviewing SAN switch logs for connectivity issues. Supporting evidence comes from known multipathd behaviors in Oracle Linux and Red Hat documentation, where repeated path failures often correlate with critical storage incidents requiring urgent intervention.

The incident involving the multipathd component indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths failing across different multipath maps (mpathf, mpathg, mpathh). The log window shows repeated failures of paths with specific identifiers (e.g., 8:208, 65:16) and the sync_map_state messages confirm that the device mapper states are in a failing condition (state 2, dmstate 2), suggesting a loss of redundancy or complete path unavailability. This behavior likely stems from underlying storage connectivity issues, potentially due to SAN fabric problems, HBA failures, or misconfigured multipath settings, which are common in Exadata environments under heavy I/O load or during hardware faults. The impact on Exadata reliability is significant as multipath failures can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to storage devices, affecting database availability. Reproduction of this issue could likely be triggered by simulating path failures or disconnecting specific storage links in a test environment. Recommended resolution includes immediate verification of storage array connectivity, checking HBA status, and reviewing multipathd configuration for errors in path prioritization or failover policies.

This incident involves the kernel component with specific failures in device-mapper multipath paths and RDS/IB connectivity, indicating a severe issue in the storage and network layers of an Exadata/Exascale system. The repeated failing paths (e.g., 8:80, 8:96, 65:0) suggest a systemic problem with storage multipath configurations or underlying hardware, potentially due to SAN connectivity loss, misconfigured multipathd, or disk failures. Additionally, the RDS/IB reconnect stalling for over a minute with packet drops points to InfiniBand network instability, which is critical for high-performance clustering in Exadata environments. The impact on system reliability and availability is high, as multipath failures can lead to data unavailability, and RDS/IB issues can disrupt database clustering and performance. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of heavy I/O load, network congestion, or by simulating path failures via manual intervention on the storage or InfiniBand network. Recommended resolution includes immediate checks on multipathd configuration, validation of storage array connectivity, and inspection of InfiniBand fabric for errors or misconfigurations using tools like ibstat or ibdiagnet. Supporting evidence comes from known kernel-level multipath issues in Oracle Linux and UEK environments, as well as frequent RDS/IB connectivity problems tied to fabric or driver issues in Exadata systems. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing device mapper multipath configurations for storage paths in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The repeated log entries indicating 'sync_map_state: failing' across multiple disk devices (sdj, sdk, sdn, etc.) with consistent state and dmstate values of 2 suggest a severe issue with path synchronization, likely due to underlying storage connectivity problems or misconfiguration in the multipath setup. Such failures can lead to significant impact on system reliability and availability, as they may result in inaccessible storage paths, degraded performance, or complete loss of redundancy for critical data access in an Exadata system. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating storage path failures or inducing network interruptions on the SAN fabric connected to the affected devices. The recommended resolution involves immediate checking of the multipath configuration files, verifying the status of storage paths using 'multipath -ll', and inspecting SAN switch logs or storage array health for underlying issues. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from known issues in device-mapper-multipath where state synchronization failures often correlate with hardware or zoning issues, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage administration guides.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is essential for managing storage path redundancy in Exadata/Exascale environments. The log window and message structure indicate multiple path failures across various maps (mpathe, mpathf, mpathg, mpathh) with consistent failing states (state 2, dmstate 2), suggesting a systemic issue with path availability or storage connectivity rather than an isolated disk failure. The likely root cause could be a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, a SAN fabric issue, or a failure in the underlying storage array communication, leading to repeated path checker failures. The impact on system reliability is significant, as loss of multiple paths can result in degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical storage resources, potentially causing database downtime or data unavailability. This behavior might be reproduced by simulating a storage controller failure or disconnecting multiple paths in a test environment to observe multipathd's response. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the SAN fabric connectivity, checking multipath.conf for incorrect settings, and reviewing storage array logs for errors or alerts. Supporting evidence comes from known issues in Device Mapper Multipath where path failures cascade due to improper failover configurations or hardware faults, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage guides.

This incident involves a kernel-level error related to the PM-Timer, which is a critical hardware timing mechanism used by the system for power management and timekeeping functions. The message structure 'kernel: pm-timer failed consistency check (<hex>) - aborting' indicates a failure in the timer's integrity check, with the specific log entry showing a hexadecimal value of 0xffffff, suggesting a complete failure or invalid state. The likely root cause is a hardware issue with the system's timer circuitry or a firmware bug in the BIOS/UEFI that mishandles the PM-Timer interface, potentially leading to system instability or incorrect timekeeping. This error can severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability, as accurate timing is essential for database operations, cluster synchronization, and RDMA communications. Reproduction of this issue might occur under specific power management state transitions or heavy system load, though it often depends on underlying hardware conditions. Recommended resolution includes immediate checking of BIOS/UEFI versions against Oracle's supported firmware list, applying updates if necessary, and running hardware diagnostics to rule out chipset or motherboard faults. Supporting evidence comes from known kernel behavior where PM-Timer failures often correlate with ACPI or hardware issues, as documented in Oracle Linux and upstream kernel resources.

This incident involves the systemd component, where repeated log entries indicate failures to load configurations for various session scopes and mount units, alongside an error about determining peer security context due to an unavailable protocol. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or absence of specific systemd unit files for session scopes and mounts, which are often dynamically created and may not be critical for system operation unless tied to specific user sessions or services. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors do not suggest a systemic failure or disruption of core services, and the system likely continues to operate without significant degradation. Reproducing this behavior could involve initiating multiple user sessions or attempting to access specific mount points without corresponding configuration files in place. The recommended resolution is to verify the systemd configuration directory for missing unit files and ensure that SELinux or other security modules are correctly configured to avoid protocol unavailability errors, though immediate action may not be necessary unless tied to a specific functional issue. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions indicating that such errors are often benign and related to transient or non-essential components rather than critical system failures.

This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager, where multiple log entries indicate failures to load configurations for session scopes and mount units, alongside issues with determining peer security context and conditional failures for sshd-keygen.service. The likely technical root cause appears to be missing configuration files or directories for transient session scopes and mount points, which are often dynamically created and may not persist across reboots or specific system states. Additionally, the sshd-keygen.service failure suggests that SSH host keys are already present, causing the condition check to fail as expected, preventing unnecessary key regeneration. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these errors do not indicate a failure of critical services or system instability but rather reflect normal behavior for conditional or transient unit handling. Reproducing this behavior could involve initiating multiple user sessions or attempting to start services with pre-existing configurations on a system with similar systemd settings. The recommended resolution is to monitor for any recurrence or associated service disruptions, but no immediate action is required beyond verifying that SSH services are operational and session scopes are not impacting user access.

This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager, exhibiting widespread communication failures across multiple services and units on an Exadata system. The log window shows repeated errors such as 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' for critical Exadata-specific services like exadata-netdiag-dump.service, exadata-dbproc-bind.service, and exadata.target, alongside fundamental system services like dbus.service and sshd.service. The likely root cause appears to be a systemic failure in systemd's inter-process communication mechanism, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus failure under high load or resource exhaustion, leading to an inability to manage or signal services effectively. This behavior severely impacts Exadata reliability and availability, as essential services fail to start, stop, or communicate status, potentially causing database or storage node outages. Reproduction could likely be triggered by simulating high system load or inducing D-Bus/socket failures during boot or service restarts. Recommended resolution includes immediate restart of systemd or the affected node if safe, followed by analysis of resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors) and checking systemd journal for prior warnings; applying Oracle Linux updates for systemd may also mitigate known bugs. Supporting evidence lies in the pervasive nature of the errors across unrelated services, a pattern often seen in systemic D-Bus or systemd socket issues as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat knowledge bases.

e4cda09e1354,scaqae03adm05,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting multiple failure conditions that disrupt normal system operation. The log messages indicate a failure to determine peer security context due to an unavailable protocol, suggesting potential issues with SELinux or security module configurations, alongside a failure to load configuration for usr.mount, which may point to a misconfigured or missing mount unit file critical for system boot. Additionally, the systemd-networkd.socket entering a failed state due to a destructive transaction and inability to queue a startup job strongly suggests a systemic issue with network service initialization, likely caused by a missing or corrupted service file. This combination of errors can severely impact system reliability, potentially preventing proper network functionality and system stability during boot or runtime. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a corrupted or missing systemd-networkd service file or by disabling necessary security protocols in the system configuration. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the integrity of systemd unit files, particularly for systemd-networkd.socket and usr.mount, ensuring SELinux is properly configured, and reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors that might have triggered these failures. Supporting evidence for criticality comes from known systemd behaviors where socket unit failures cascade to dependent services, often documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat Enterprise Linux troubleshooting guides for systemd initialization issues.

f7b432aa91f6,scaqae03adm05,systemd,1,0.9,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread failures in communication and unit management during what appears to be a system shutdown or reboot sequence. The log window shows repeated errors such as 'Failed to send unit remove signal' with 'Transport endpoint is not connected' across a vast array of services and devices, indicating a systemic issue in systemd's ability to gracefully handle unit termination, likely due to a socket or D-Bus communication breakdown. Additionally, errors like 'Failed to determine peer security context: Protocol not available' suggest potential issues with SELinux or security context handling, which could exacerbate the problem. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as this behavior can lead to improper service shutdown, potential data corruption, or failure to reboot correctly, affecting critical database and storage operations. This issue could potentially be reproduced by initiating a system shutdown or reboot under similar conditions, possibly with a misconfigured systemd or during high system load. Recommended resolution includes verifying systemd configuration files for errors, checking for SELinux policy mismatches, and reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors that might have triggered this cascade. If unresolved, escalating to Oracle Support for a deeper analysis of systemd and kernel interactions is advised. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected services and the consistent error pattern, which aligns with known systemd issues in Oracle Linux environments under specific failure conditions.

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically related to the failure to load a configuration for a service named higgs-compute-agent-reset-bridges.service, with an associated error of connection reset by peer during a unit remove signal. The root cause appears to be a missing configuration file for the mentioned service, which is not a standard systemd or Exadata-specific service, suggesting it might be a custom or third-party unit file that was improperly configured or deleted. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this error does not pertain to core system services or critical infrastructure components like cellsrv or ohasd, and there is no indication of broader systemd instability in the log window. Reproducing this behavior would likely involve creating or referencing a non-existent or misconfigured service unit file in systemd and attempting to manage it via systemctl commands. The recommended resolution is to verify if this service is required; if not, remove any lingering references to it using systemctl reset-failed or manually clean up residual unit files in /etc/systemd/system or /usr/lib/systemd/system. Supporting evidence comes from systemd's behavior of logging non-critical errors when it cannot locate configuration files for non-essential services, a common occurrence in environments with custom or stale unit files as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides.

This incident involves systemd failing to load configurations for specific mount units (mnt.mount and mnt-imaging.mount) and a session scope (session-259.scope), as evidenced by the repeated 'No such file or directory' errors in the log window. The likely technical root cause is that these unit files or their associated paths are missing or misconfigured, which could stem from a manual configuration error, an incomplete system update, or a removed package that previously defined these units. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal since these errors do not indicate a failure of core systemd functionality or critical system services, and the system likely continues to operate without these specific mounts or sessions.

8299b935fd72,scaqae03adm05,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component failing to load the configuration for autofs.service due to the file or directory not being present, as evident from the repeated error messages in the log window. The likely technical root cause is that the autofs.service unit file is either missing or not installed on the system, which prevents systemd from processing related method calls like StopUnit. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal since autofs is typically used for automounting file systems and is not a core component of the database or storage services. Reproducing this behavior would involve intentionally removing or not installing the autofs package and then attempting to manage the service via systemctl commands. The recommended resolution is to verify if autofs is required in the environment; if not, the error can be safely ignored, but if needed, the autofs package should be installed to provide the missing configuration. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and common Linux administration practices where missing unit files result in non-critical errors unless the service is essential to the workload.

d247a6ca08c4,scaqae03adm05,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for various mount points and services are reported as missing during the system initialization or a systemd reload operation. The likely technical root cause is that these configuration files were never created or were removed, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux installations for Exadata systems where unnecessary services and mount points are not defined. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as the missing configurations pertain to non-essential or unused services and mount points like display-manager.service, ntpd.service, and various disk-by-label mounts that are not critical for core database or storage operations. Reproducing this behavior would involve running a systemd daemon-reload or system boot on a system where these configuration files are intentionally omitted or deleted. The recommended resolution is to ignore these messages unless a specific service or mount point is required for operational needs, in which case the missing configuration should be created or restored from a backup. Supporting evidence comes from common practices in Oracle Linux and Exadata environments where systemd configurations are streamlined to avoid unnecessary overhead, and such messages are often seen in logs without operational impact.

f0652d5e40b5,scaqae03adm05,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. The incident involving systemd indicates a critical failure of the dbserverd.service, which has transitioned to a failed state as evidenced by the log entries. This component is crucial for database server operations within an Exadata environment, and its failure likely stems from missing or misconfigured service dependencies or mount points, as suggested by the extensive list of 'failed to load configuration' errors for various mounts and services. The impact on Exadata reliability is significant, as the failure of dbserverd.service could disrupt database availability and affect overall system performance. This behavior might be reproducible by simulating a misconfiguration or deletion of critical systemd unit files or mount configurations during system boot or service restart. To mitigate this, immediate steps should include verifying the integrity of systemd configuration files, ensuring all required mount points are correctly defined in /etc/fstab or related configs, and restarting the dbserverd.service after resolving dependencies. Supporting evidence includes the explicit log entries about the service entering a failed state, which aligns with known systemd behavior when critical dependencies are unmet, often documented in Oracle Linux and systemd troubleshooting guides. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

9f459a3e6965,scaqae03adm05,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during system initialization or operation. The likely root cause is that these configuration files are either not required for the current system setup or are remnants of a generator or template that systemd attempts to load by default but are not present in this specific Exadata environment. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability appears minimal, as these messages are typically benign and do not indicate active failures of critical services or mounts—core system functionality is likely unaffected based on the absence of follow-up errors or crashes in the log window. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during system boot or when systemd reloads its configuration, especially if the system has been customized or if certain packages or services are not installed. The recommended resolution is to suppress these messages by masking unnecessary units or ensuring that systemd does not attempt to load irrelevant configurations, potentially through adjustment of systemd presets or by cleaning up stale generator outputs. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior on Oracle Linux and Red Hat-based systems, where such messages are often seen in minimal or specialized configurations without operational impact, as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides.

3c5578f65abd,scaqae03adm05,systemd,-1,0.75,"Severity Assessment: Unclear. This incident involves the systemd component, which is critical for system initialization and service management on Oracle Linux systems used in Exadata/Exascale environments. The log window shows an extensive list of 'Failed to load configuration' errors for numerous mount points and services, including critical ones like ohasd.service and oracle-ohasd.service, which are related to Oracle High Availability Services. Additionally, there are 'Connection reset by peer' errors for unit change signals, indicating potential communication issues within systemd or with other system components. The root cause could be a misconfiguration in systemd unit files, a corrupted filesystem, or an incomplete system update that left configuration files missing or inaccessible. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is uncertain but potentially significant if key services like ohasd fail to start, as they are essential for cluster management and database availability. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating a system update failure or manually removing systemd configuration files to observe similar errors. Recommended steps include verifying the integrity of systemd configuration files in /etc/systemd and /usr/lib/systemd, checking for recent system changes or updates, and reviewing journalctl logs for additional context on systemd failures. Given the breadth of affected services and mounts, this incident requires deeper triage to confirm whether it represents a transient issue or a systemic problem. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

c8cbfc129cd5,scaqae03adm05,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, critical to the operation of Exadata/Exascale systems. The log window shows widespread failures in systemd's ability to manage services and units, with repeated errors such as 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' across a broad range of services including sshd, crond, rsyslog, and Exadata-specific units like exadata.target and exawatcher.service. These errors suggest a systemic communication breakdown within systemd, likely caused by a failure in the D-Bus communication layer or a corrupted systemd state, potentially triggered by a system crash, resource exhaustion, or improper shutdown. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as critical services failing to start or communicate can lead to loss of system functionality, monitoring, and management capabilities. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of sudden system termination or high resource contention affecting systemd's control socket. Recommended resolution includes restarting the systemd daemon if possible, inspecting journalctl for preceding errors, and verifying system resource availability; if unresolved, a system reboot may be necessary to reset the state. Supporting evidence includes the pattern of errors affecting multiple unrelated services simultaneously, which aligns with known systemd issues under stress or failure conditions as documented in upstream systemd and Oracle Linux resources.

668f45c926ca,scaqae03adm05,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread failures in sending unit remove signals across a vast array of services and devices, as evidenced by the repeated 'Transport endpoint is not connected' errors in the log window. The likely technical root cause appears to be a systemic communication breakdown within systemd, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus failure during a system shutdown or reboot sequence, leading to an inability to properly manage service termination. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as this behavior can result in improper service shutdowns, potential data corruption, or incomplete resource release, affecting critical components like oracle-ohasd.service and exadata-specific services. This issue could likely be reproduced during a system reboot or forced shutdown under heavy load or with a misconfigured systemd environment. Recommended resolution includes immediate investigation into systemd logs and D-Bus status prior to the incident, checking for underlying network or socket issues, and potentially updating systemd to a patched version if a known bug is identified. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected services and targets in the log, which aligns with known systemd issues in high-complexity environments like Oracle Exadata, where improper shutdown sequences have historically caused cascading failures. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

f18154094bbd,scaqae03adm05,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread failures in unmounting filesystems and sending unit remove signals across a vast array of services and devices during what appears to be a system shutdown or reboot sequence. The likely technical root cause is a systemic failure in systemd's communication mechanism, as evidenced by repeated 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' errors, suggesting a breakdown in socket or inter-process communication possibly due to an abrupt termination or resource exhaustion. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as this behavior indicates potential data corruption risks from improper unmounting (e.g., /proc/xen and boot-efi.mount failures) and failure to cleanly stop critical services like ohasd and rdma-related units, which could disrupt database and network operations. This issue could likely be reproduced during a forced shutdown or under high system load conditions where systemd struggles to manage resource cleanup, potentially triggered by a kernel panic or manual intervention. Recommended resolution steps include analyzing preceding logs for kernel or hardware errors that might have precipitated this state, ensuring systemd is updated to the latest stable version to address known bugs, and verifying system resource limits to prevent exhaustion scenarios. Supporting evidence includes the sheer volume of affected units, including Exadata-specific services like exadata-capacity-on-demand and exachkcfg, pointing to a cascading failure with broader implications, consistent with known systemd issues under stress as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat knowledge bases. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

febbaa58c906,scaqae03adm05 | scaqae03adm06,systemd-networkd,-1,0.7,"Severity Assessment: Unclear. The incident involves systemd-networkd, a critical component responsible for managing network configurations in modern Linux distributions, including Oracle Linux used in Exadata environments. The error message 'Event loop failed: Transport endpoint is not connected' suggests a potential disruption in the network service's ability to maintain connections, which could stem from underlying network stack issues, socket closures, or misconfigurations in the networkd service. This type of failure might impact network availability or reliability on the Exadata system, potentially affecting communication between nodes or with external services if persistent. Reproduction could likely be attempted by simulating network interruptions or socket failures during high load or failover scenarios to observe if systemd-networkd handles the event loop failure gracefully. Given the lack of developer feedback and limited context in the log window, it is challenging to definitively classify this as critical or ignorable without additional logs or system state information. A recommended next step is to investigate related journalctl logs for systemd-networkd and check network interface status to identify any preceding errors or warnings that might indicate the root cause. This issue needs triage to determine if it represents a transient glitch or a deeper systemic problem, potentially drawing on known systemd behaviors documented in Oracle Linux and freedesktop resources.

0b55c4598f6a,scaqae03adm05vm01,kernel,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to storage device errors during a synchronize cache operation across multiple drives (sda, sdb, sdc, sdd). The error message 'hostbyte=DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST driverbyte=DRIVER_OK' indicates a transport layer failure, likely due to a temporary disconnect or failure in the storage path, which could stem from issues like faulty cabling, HBA failures, or SAN disruptions in an Exadata environment. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant as this failure can lead to data integrity issues or potential service interruptions if the affected drives are part of critical database storage grids. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating transport layer interruptions or stress-testing the storage subsystem under heavy I/O load to observe cache synchronization failures. The recommended resolution includes immediate checks on storage connectivity, HBA status, and multipath configurations, followed by reviewing kernel logs for preceding errors and potentially engaging storage vendor support for deeper diagnostics. Supporting evidence comes from known kernel behaviors where DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST often correlates with transient path failures, as documented in Linux kernel storage troubleshooting guides.

The incident involving the multipathd component indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths being marked as failed across several multipath maps (mpathb, mpathc, mpathd) and individual devices (sda, sdc, sde, sdg, sdi, sdk). This behavior suggests a systemic failure in the storage subsystem, potentially due to a hardware issue with the underlying disks, a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, or a failure in the storage controller or SAN connectivity. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the loss of multiple paths can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical storage resources, potentially causing database or application downtime. This issue could likely be reproduced by simulating a storage hardware failure or disconnecting multiple paths in a test environment to observe multipathd behavior. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of physical storage connectivity, checking for hardware errors in logs like /var/log/messages or dmesg, running multipath -ll to inspect path states, and potentially reconfiguring or reinitializing the multipath setup if no hardware fault is found. Supporting evidence comes from known issues in multipathd where simultaneous path failures often correlate with SAN fabric disruptions or disk array issues, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage troubleshooting guides.

613ef22dd96c,scaqae03adm05vm01,multipathd,1,0.9,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The log window and message structure indicate a widespread failure of multiple paths across several multipath maps (mpatha, mpathb, mpathc, mpathd), with consistent 'checker failed path' errors and 'sync_map_state: failing' messages for numerous devices (sda, sdc, sdd, etc.), all showing a state of 2 (likely indicating a failed or offline state). The likely root cause appears to be a storage connectivity issue, such as a SAN failure, zoning misconfiguration, or a hardware fault in the storage array or HBAs, leading to the unavailability of multiple paths simultaneously. This behavior poses a severe risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as it could result in data inaccessibility or degraded performance due to the loss of redundancy in storage paths. Reproduction of this issue might be achieved by simulating a storage network disruption or unplugging multiple paths to the storage devices in a test environment. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of SAN connectivity, checking HBA status, reviewing multipath configuration files for errors, and inspecting storage array logs for faults or alerts. Supporting evidence comes from the repetitive and systemic nature of the path failures across multiple devices and maps, which aligns with known multipathd behavior during storage outages as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat storage administration guides.

The incident involves the systemd component, where the system is repeatedly failing to load the configuration for opensmd.service due to the file or directory not being found. This error typically indicates that the service configuration file is missing or incorrectly referenced in the systemd configuration, which is a common issue during system updates or misconfigurations. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is negligible, as opensmd.service is not a core service required for the primary functionality of the system, and there are no indications of broader systemic failures in the log window. This behavior could likely be reproduced by intentionally removing or misnaming the service configuration file for opensmd.service in the systemd directory. The recommended resolution is to verify the existence and correct path of the opensmd.service configuration file, and if necessary, reinstall the associated package or restore the file from a backup. Supporting evidence suggests this is a standard systemd behavior when encountering missing service files, as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides and Oracle Linux documentation.

53d60fa3ebea,scaqae03adm06,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager, where multiple configuration files for transient scopes and mounts such as session-<num>.scope, run.mount, and run-user.mount are reported as missing. Additionally, the sshd-keygen.service fails to start due to missing SSH host key files, and a connection reset error occurs when attempting to send a unit change signal for sshd.service. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or incomplete setup of systemd units and SSH key files during system initialization or updates, which prevents the loading of certain non-essential scopes and the generation of SSH keys. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors pertain to transient session scopes and optional SSH key generation, which do not directly affect core database or storage services. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating a system boot or update where systemd configuration files are missing or SSH host keys are not pre-generated. The recommended resolution is to verify and restore the missing systemd configuration files if necessary, and ensure SSH host keys are generated or copied to the expected locations in /etc/ssh/. Supporting evidence suggests that such errors are often seen in environments with custom or incomplete systemd setups, as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd official resources, and they typically do not escalate to critical failures unless tied to broader system instability.

The incident involves the systemd component, which is failing to load a configuration for a transient service unit named run-83569.service and encountering communication errors such as 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected'. These errors typically indicate a temporary or non-existent service unit file, often associated with a transient or dynamically created service that has already been removed or was improperly initiated. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these errors do not suggest a systemic failure of systemd or critical system services, but rather a localized issue with a specific transient unit. Reproduction of this behavior could likely occur by attempting to manage a non-existent or improperly defined transient service unit via systemctl commands during high system load or resource contention. The recommended resolution is to verify if the run-83569.service is expected to exist or was a temporary unit created by a script or process, and if not required, no further action is needed beyond clearing stale references if they persist in systemd's state. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from systemd's documentation on transient units and known behaviors where communication errors occur due to race conditions or cleanup of temporary units, as noted in Oracle Linux and upstream systemd resources.

This incident involves the systemd component on an Exadata system, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during system initialization or a systemd reload operation. The likely root cause is that these configuration files were either never created, were removed, or are not required for the specific system configuration, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux installations on Exadata systems. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability appears negligible since these errors typically do not prevent core system functionality or critical services from starting, especially as key Exadata components like cellsrv or ohasd are not directly implicated in a failure state within the log window. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during system boot or after a 'systemctl daemon-reload' command if the expected configuration files are absent or if systemd is scanning for units that are not applicable to the environment. As a resolution, it is recommended to verify the system configuration and ignore these messages if the system is functioning as expected, or alternatively, suppress these warnings by masking unnecessary units via 'systemctl mask' for the reported services and mounts. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where such errors are often benign unless accompanied by explicit service failures or dependency issues, which are not observed here.

The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these messages typically do not indicate an active failure of running services but rather an inability to locate configurations for optional or non-essential units that may not be required for core functionality. Reproducing this behavior could likely be achieved by triggering a systemd daemon-reload or system boot on a system where certain packages or configurations are missing or misconfigured. The recommended resolution is to verify if these services or mounts are intended to be present; if not, these messages can be safely ignored, or alternatively, suppress such warnings by masking unnecessary units via systemctl mask to prevent cluttering logs. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions on Oracle Linux, where such messages are often noted as non-critical unless tied to a specific service failure or dependency issue.

f7c9565933ea,scaqae03adm06,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves a systemd error related to the firewalld.service unit, where a 'connection reset by peer' message was logged during an attempt to send a unit remove signal. The error suggests a transient communication issue between systemd and the firewalld service, likely due to the service already terminating or a socket closure before the signal could be processed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as firewalld.service is not a core component of the database or storage stack, and this error does not indicate a broader systemic failure. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during rapid service restarts or system shutdowns when systemd attempts to manage units that are no longer responsive. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if persistent, check systemd and firewalld logs for underlying socket or timing issues, though no immediate action is required. This assessment is supported by known systemd behavior in handling transient connection errors, as documented in official resources, which often classify such messages as non-impacting unless accompanied by service failures.

This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous log entries indicate a failure to load configurations for various mount points and services due to missing files or directories. The likely root cause is that these configuration files are either not present on the system or are not required for the current operational context of an Exadata environment, which often has a customized systemd setup tailored to specific roles like database or storage nodes. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible since these messages do not indicate active service failures or dependency issues that would disrupt core functionality. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a minimal or misconfigured systemd setup where expected configuration files are absent. As a resolution, I recommend verifying the systemd configuration against Oracle's Exadata deployment guidelines to ensure only necessary services and mounts are defined, and suppressing or masking irrelevant units via systemctl if needed. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior where it logs such errors during boot for optional or non-critical components without affecting system stability, a pattern often seen in Oracle Linux environments tailored for Exadata.

4e7626246ea5,scaqae03adm06,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. The incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, reporting numerous failures to load configuration files for various mount points and services during system boot or operation. These errors, characterized by 'No such file or directory' messages across a wide range of mount units and services like oracle-ohasd.service and ohasd.service, typically indicate that systemd is attempting to load configuration for units that are not present or not applicable in the current system configuration, often due to a minimal or customized installation. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or absence of expected unit files in a tailored Exadata environment, where not all standard systemd units are deployed or required. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors do not suggest active service failures or operational disruptions but rather reflect systemd's verbose logging of non-critical missing configurations. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting an Exadata system with a stripped-down or non-standard set of systemd unit files, which is common in specialized environments. The recommended resolution is to review the systemd configuration and suppress these warnings by masking unnecessary units or adjusting log levels if they are not relevant to the system's role. Supporting evidence comes from systemd's known behavior of logging such errors harmlessly when expected configurations are absent, as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd upstream resources. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

828facf041a8,scaqae03adm06,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, where the dbserverd.service has explicitly transitioned to a failed state, indicating a significant issue with a core service likely tied to database operations on an Exadata system. The likely technical root cause appears to be a failure in the dbserverd.service initialization or runtime, compounded by systemd's inability to load configurations for numerous mount points and services, suggesting potential misconfiguration or corruption in the systemd unit files or related filesystem structures. The impact on Exadata reliability and availability is high, as the failure of dbserverd.service could disrupt database functionality or accessibility, critical for operational continuity. This behavior might be reproduced by simulating a failure in service dependencies or corrupting specific systemd configuration files, though exact conditions would require deeper log analysis. Recommended resolution steps include immediate inspection of the dbserverd.service logs for specific error messages, verification of systemd unit file integrity, and ensuring all dependent filesystems are properly mounted. Supporting evidence comes from the explicit 'failed' state transition in the logs, a pattern often associated with critical service disruptions in Oracle environments, particularly when combined with widespread configuration loading failures as seen here. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

b221035f0100,scaqae03adm06,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during system initialization or operation. The likely technical root cause is that these configuration files are either not required for the current system setup or are remnants of a template or automated configuration process that did not clean up unused entries. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors typically do not prevent core system functionality or critical services from starting, especially since no operational failures or dependency issues are evident in the log window. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a similar configuration or manually removing referenced configuration files to observe systemd's response. The recommended resolution is to review the systemd configuration and remove or suppress warnings for unnecessary or obsolete units to reduce log noise, potentially using systemctl mask or by adjusting the system configuration scripts. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions indicating that such errors are often benign unless accompanied by failed dependencies or critical service disruptions, which are not present here.

f756bf4bd8be,scaqae03adm06,systemd,-1,0.75,"Severity Assessment: Unclear. This incident involves the systemd component, which is critical for system initialization and service management in Oracle Linux environments. The log window shows a large number of 'Failed to load configuration' errors for various mount points and services, including critical ones like oracle-ohasd.service and ohasd.service, alongside errors like 'Connection reset by peer' for systemd-logind.service and sshd.service. The root cause likely stems from missing or corrupted systemd unit files, possibly due to a misconfiguration, incomplete system update, or filesystem issues during boot. While these errors could impact system reliability by preventing essential services from starting, it is unclear without additional context whether this is a transient issue during boot or a persistent failure affecting Exadata availability. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating a system update or manually removing systemd configuration files to observe boot behavior. Recommended steps include verifying the integrity of systemd unit files in /etc/systemd and /usr/lib/systemd, checking for recent system changes, and reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors. The involvement of Exadata-specific services like ohasd in the error list raises concerns about potential impacts on cluster services. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

b5011f7fb3f9,scaqae03adm06,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, exhibiting widespread communication failures across multiple services and targets on an Exadata system. The log window and message structure reveal repeated errors such as 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' affecting critical Exadata-specific units like exadata.target, exadata-netdiag-dump.service, and EXAVMIMAGES.mount, alongside fundamental system services like dbus, sshd, and rsyslog. The likely root cause appears to be a systemic failure in systemd's inter-process communication mechanism, possibly due to a socket or cgroup management issue, as evidenced by failures to destroy cgroups and propagate agent release messages. This behavior severely impacts system reliability and availability, as it disrupts service state management and could prevent proper initialization or shutdown of critical Exadata components. Reproduction might involve triggering a high load or abrupt termination of systemd-managed processes to simulate socket disconnection or resource contention. Recommended resolution includes restarting systemd or rebooting the node to reset communication channels, followed by checking journalctl for preceding errors and verifying systemd version compatibility with Oracle Linux on Exadata. Supporting evidence includes the failure of systemd-networkd.socket entering a failed state, which indicates a deeper issue in network service initialization, and known systemd issues in Oracle Linux environments under heavy load or misconfiguration scenarios. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

4b3effafd398,scaqae03adm06,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, which is failing to send unit remove signals for a wide array of services and targets during a shutdown or reboot process. The repeated 'Transport endpoint is not connected' and 'Connection reset by peer' errors across multiple units, including critical Exadata-specific services like exachkcfg.service and exavmnetwork.service, suggest a systemic issue with systemd's communication mechanism, potentially due to a socket or D-Bus failure under load or during an abrupt termination. The root cause likely stems from a timing issue or resource contention during the shutdown sequence, where systemd is unable to properly clean up or communicate with dependent units, leading to cascading failures. This behavior could severely impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by preventing proper service termination, risking data corruption or incomplete state transitions during reboots. Reproducing this issue might involve simulating a rapid shutdown or inducing high system load during a reboot to stress systemd's unit management. Mitigation steps include reviewing systemd configuration for timeout settings, ensuring proper D-Bus functionality, and applying any relevant Oracle Linux patches for systemd behavior under stress. Supporting evidence includes the broad scope of affected units in the log window, which indicates a systemic rather than isolated failure, and known issues in systemd with socket handling under certain kernel configurations as documented in upstream bug trackers. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This incident involves systemd and focuses on multiple condition failures during the boot process for dracut-related services and other systemd units. The log messages indicate that various kernel command line parameters and path existence checks failed for services like dracut-pre-udev.service and dracut-initqueue.service, which are part of the early boot initialization in Oracle Linux or similar environments. Additionally, configuration files for sys.mount and sys-kernel.mount could not be loaded, likely due to missing or misconfigured unit files. These messages are typically informational and reflect expected behavior during boot when certain conditions or configurations are not met, rather than indicating a failure or misconfiguration that impacts system stability. The potential impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is negligible, as these failed conditions do not prevent the system from booting or functioning correctly in most cases. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting a system with specific kernel command line parameters absent or with missing dracut hook scripts in the expected directories. The recommended resolution is to ignore these messages unless they correlate with actual boot failures or service disruptions, in which case verifying the systemd unit files and dracut configuration may be necessary. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions, which classify such condition failures as non-critical during boot unless tied to broader issues.

f00dcfff3b40,scaqae03adm06,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, which is showing widespread communication failures across multiple services. The log window indicates repeated errors such as 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected' for a broad range of services including systemd-logind, crond, sshd, and Exadata-specific services like exachkcfg and exadata-netdiag-dump, culminating in the explicit failure of exachkcfg.service. The likely technical root cause is a systemic issue with systemd's inter-process communication, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus failure under high load or resource exhaustion, disrupting service state propagation. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability, as critical services like sshd and Exadata-specific monitoring components are unable to operate or report status correctly, potentially leading to undetected failures or degraded availability. Reproduction of this issue could likely be triggered by simulating high system load or inducing D-Bus connection timeouts during service state changes. Recommended resolution includes restarting the systemd daemon to reset communication channels, followed by checking system resource usage (CPU, memory, file descriptors) and D-Bus logs for underlying issues; if persistent, escalation to Oracle support for deeper analysis of systemd behavior in Exadata environments is advised. Supporting evidence includes the explicit failure state of exachkcfg.service and the pattern of transport endpoint errors, which align with known systemd issues under stress as documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the failure of systemd-networkd.service and systemd-networkd.socket, which are crucial for network configuration and management on Oracle Linux systems used in Exadata environments. The likely technical root cause is a missing or corrupted service file for systemd-networkd, as hinted by the log message regarding the failure to queue a startup job due to a 'destructive transaction'. This failure can severely impact network connectivity and management, potentially leading to loss of communication between Exadata components, affecting overall system availability and reliability. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by intentionally removing or misconfiguring the systemd-networkd service file and restarting the system to observe the failure state. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the presence and integrity of the systemd-networkd.service file, reinstalling the systemd package if necessary, and checking for any conflicting network configurations or recent system updates that might have triggered this behavior. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from known systemd behaviors documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where service file issues are a common cause of such failures, often requiring manual intervention to restore functionality.

The incident involves the systemd component failing to unmount /proc/xen, which is a virtual filesystem related to Xen virtualization. This error typically occurs during system shutdown or reboot when systemd attempts to clean up mounts but finds that /proc/xen is either already unmounted or inaccessible. The root cause is likely a timing issue or a misconfiguration in the systemd shutdown sequence, though it does not indicate a deeper issue with the Exadata/Exascale environment since Xen is not a core component of these systems. The impact on system reliability or availability is negligible as /proc/xen is not critical to Oracle database operations or storage cell functionality. Reproducing this behavior would involve initiating a system shutdown or reboot and observing systemd logs for mount-related failures. The recommended resolution is to ignore this message unless it correlates with other systemic failures, and if persistent, review systemd configuration for unnecessary Xen-related mounts. This assessment is supported by systemd documentation and community reports indicating that such unmount failures are often benign and context-specific to virtualization environments not relevant to Exadata.

This incident involves the kernel component, specifically related to storage path failures as evidenced by repeated 'Synchronize Cache(10) failed' errors across multiple disk devices (sde to sdp) with the hostbyte result 'DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST'. The likely technical root cause is a transport layer failure in the storage subsystem, potentially due to a SAN connectivity issue, faulty hardware, or a driver-level timeout under heavy I/O load, leading to multipath path failures as seen in the log window with repeated 'Failing path' messages. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is severe, as these errors indicate potential data access interruptions or complete storage path unavailability, which could degrade database performance or cause service outages. This behavior could likely be reproduced under conditions of high I/O stress, storage network instability, or by simulating hardware faults on the affected paths. Recommended resolution steps include immediate checks on storage array connectivity, review of multipath configuration for failover policies, and inspection of hardware logs for underlying failures, followed by potential driver updates or firmware patches if a known issue is identified. Supporting evidence comes from kernel documentation on SCSI error handling, where 'DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST' often correlates with transport layer disruptions, and precedents in Oracle Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) environments where similar multipath failures have led to critical storage issues.

The recommended resolution involves immediate checking of storage connectivity, validation of multipath configuration files for errors, and potentially restarting the multipathd service after resolving underlying issues. Supporting evidence for this severity comes from known multipathd behaviors in Oracle Linux and Red Hat documentation, where persistent path failures are treated as critical due to their impact on I/O operations.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in an Exadata/Exascale environment, ensuring redundancy and failover for storage paths. The log window and message structure indicate repeated failures of multiple paths (e.g., 8:80, 8:96) across different maps (mpathc, mpathd) with consistent state failures (state 2, dmstate 2), suggesting a systemic issue with path availability or connectivity to storage devices. The likely root cause could be a hardware failure in the storage array, a misconfiguration in the multipath setup, or a failure in the underlying SAN fabric, leading to multiple path failures. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability, as loss of multiple storage paths can result in degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical data volumes, potentially impacting database availability. Reproduction of this issue might involve simulating path failures or disconnecting specific storage links to observe multipathd behavior under stress. Recommended resolution includes immediate validation of the storage hardware and SAN connectivity, rechecking multipath configuration files for errors, and potentially reinitializing failed paths using multipathd commands. Supporting evidence comes from known issues in multipathd where repeated path failures often correlate with underlying hardware or zoning issues in storage environments, as documented in Oracle and Red Hat storage troubleshooting guides.

The incident involves NetworkManager, a standard networking configuration service, reporting warnings about missing IPv4 addresses in the configuration files for InfiniBand interfaces (ib0 and ib1) under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration in the ifcfg files where the 'method=manual' setting requires explicit IP address definitions, which are absent, triggering these warnings during the loading process. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal as these are non-fatal warnings and do not indicate a service failure or operational disruption, assuming fallback or alternative configurations are in place. Reproducing this behavior is straightforward by setting 'method=manual' in an ifcfg file without specifying an IP address and restarting NetworkManager. The recommended resolution is to update the configuration files with valid IPv4 addresses or adjust the method to 'auto' if manual configuration is not required. Supporting evidence comes from NetworkManager's expected behavior to issue warnings for incomplete configurations, as documented in official resources, and such issues are commonly seen in environments where manual network setups are incompletely defined.

This issue likely stems from a network configuration error, such as the IP addresses not being properly assigned to the host or another process already binding to these addresses. The impact on Exadata reliability is significant since SSH access is crucial for administrative tasks and automated health checks, potentially leading to management disruptions or failure in monitoring critical system health. This behavior could be reproduced by intentionally misconfiguring network interfaces or by having multiple services attempting to bind to the same IP-port combination. To resolve this, I recommend verifying the network configuration on the host scaqae03celadm07.us.oracle.com, ensuring the IPs are correctly assigned, and checking for conflicting services using tools like netstat or ss.

This incident involves systemd failing to destroy a cgroup for the rc-oracle-exadata-zero.service due to a 'device or resource busy' condition, which is a common transient issue in systemd when resources are still in use during cleanup. The error typically arises when a process or resource associated with the cgroup has not fully released, often due to timing issues or lingering dependencies during service shutdown. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is negligible as this error does not indicate a failure of the service itself but rather a housekeeping issue in systemd's cgroup management. Reproducing this behavior could involve rapid start-stop cycles of the rc-oracle-exadata-zero.service under load to simulate resource contention. The recommended resolution is to monitor if this error persists across reboots or service restarts; if it does not, no action is needed, though a systemd journal review for related errors could provide additional context.

This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata/Exascale reliability, as it indicates that systemd is unable to properly manage or clean up service states, potentially leading to orphaned processes or incomplete shutdowns that could disrupt database or storage cell operations.

The incident involves systemd, a critical system and service manager in Oracle Linux environments, which is responsible for managing service states and cgroups. The log messages indicate failures in destroying a cgroup for rc-oracle-exadata.service due to a 'device or resource busy' condition, alongside multiple communication errors such as 'connection reset by peer' and 'transport endpoint is not connected' during signal transmission for job removal and unit state changes. These errors suggest potential issues with systemd's internal state or resource contention, possibly due to a misconfiguration, a transient system overload, or an underlying kernel issue affecting cgroup management. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability could be significant if these failures prevent proper service initialization or termination, potentially leading to orphaned processes or inconsistent system states.

The log window shows widespread communication failures with repeated 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected' errors across numerous services, indicating a systemic issue with systemd's ability to manage and communicate with units. The likely technical root cause is a failure in the D-Bus communication layer or a systemd crash/restart that left sockets or endpoints in an inconsistent state, disrupting service management. This behavior severely impacts Exadata/Exascale reliability and availability, as essential services like sshd, dbus, rsyslog, and Exadata-specific components (e.g., exadata-netdiag-dump, exadata-dbproc-bind) are unable to receive state change signals, potentially leading to service outages or unresponsiveness. Reproduction could likely be triggered by inducing a systemd crash or network socket failure during high load or a forced reboot scenario. Recommended resolution includes restarting systemd or the affected host to reset communication channels, followed by a detailed review of systemd journal logs for preceding errors and ensuring the latest systemd patches are applied to mitigate known bugs.

The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the systemd-networkd.socket unit, which is responsible for managing network configurations in a Linux environment, including Oracle Exadata systems. The error message indicates a failure to queue the service startup job, likely due to a missing or misconfigured service file, compounded by a 'transaction is destructive' state, suggesting a broader issue with systemd's ability to manage dependent services. This failure can lead to significant impact on network availability, potentially disrupting communication between Exadata components or external systems, which is critical for database and cluster operations. The issue could likely be reproduced by intentionally corrupting or removing the systemd-networkd.socket configuration file and restarting the systemd daemon. To resolve this, immediate steps should include verifying the presence and integrity of the systemd-networkd.socket file, checking for recent system updates or manual changes that might have caused the misconfiguration, and restarting the systemd-networkd service after correction. Supporting evidence comes from known systemd behaviors where missing unit files or destructive transactions often result in failed states, as documented in official systemd resources and Oracle Linux guides.

137f76cdd8c1,scaqai03adm05,systemd,1,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, which is fundamental to system initialization and service management on Oracle Linux systems used in Exadata/Exascale environments. The extensive log entries showing 'Failed to send unit remove signal' with errors like 'Connection reset by peer' and 'Transport endpoint is not connected' across a vast array of services and devices indicate a severe communication breakdown within systemd's control mechanisms. The likely technical root cause is a failure in the systemd inter-process communication, possibly due to a socket or D-Bus issue during a system shutdown or reboot sequence, leading to incomplete cleanup of unit states. This behavior could significantly impact Exadata/Exascale reliability by preventing proper service termination or initialization, potentially causing orphaned processes or resource contention during subsequent boots. Reproduction of this issue might occur under stress conditions like abrupt power loss, forced reboots, or during heavy I/O operations that disrupt systemd's ability to manage units. Recommended resolution steps include checking for systemd version compatibility with the Oracle Linux kernel, reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors, and ensuring no underlying hardware or network issues (like RDMA/IB failures) are disrupting communication. Supporting evidence comes from known systemd issues in high-availability systems where socket errors during shutdown can cascade into broader system instability, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux knowledge bases. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

This incident involves the systemd component, where multiple log entries indicate a failure to load configuration files for session scopes (e.g., session-105.scope) and a specific service (higgs-compute-agent-reset-bridges.service) due to missing files. The likely root cause is either a misconfiguration or the absence of these configuration files, which could result from an incomplete installation, manual deletion, or a non-standard setup not aligned with systemd expectations. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as session scopes are typically transient and tied to user sessions, and the specific service mentioned does not appear to be a core system component critical to database or storage operations. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by removing or failing to install the relevant systemd unit files and then triggering systemd to load them during system initialization or user login. The recommended resolution is to verify the presence of these configuration files in the appropriate systemd directories and reinstall or regenerate them if necessary, ensuring alignment with the system's expected configuration.

The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these errors are typically associated with user session management rather than critical system services or database operations. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during abrupt user session terminations or system resource constraints affecting systemd's ability to maintain session state. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence and ensure proper user session cleanup procedures are in place, with no immediate action required unless paired with broader systemd or system instability.

This incident involves the systemd component, which is critical for managing services and system initialization in an Oracle Exadata/Exascale environment.

The likely technical root cause could be a misconfiguration in systemd unit files or an incomplete installation of Exadata-specific monitoring services, which may prevent proper system operation. The impact on reliability or availability is uncertain but could be significant if these services are essential for monitoring or managing Exadata components, potentially leading to undetected hardware or performance issues. Reproducing this behavior might involve intentionally removing or corrupting systemd unit files for these services and observing systemd's response during system boot or service queries. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the presence and correctness of systemd unit files for the mentioned services, checking for recent system updates or configuration changes, and consulting Exadata-specific documentation for proper service setup. Supporting evidence comes from the repetitive nature of the errors in the log window, which indicates a systemic issue rather than a transient failure, and the involvement of Exadata-specific services raises the possibility of a platform-specific bug or misconfiguration.

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically related to systemd-logind.service and sshd-keygen.service, where a connection reset by peer error is observed alongside failed conditions for starting the sshd-keygen.service due to missing SSH host key files. The likely technical root cause is that the SSH host keys are not present in the expected locations, which is a common scenario during initial system setup or after a configuration reset, causing systemd to skip starting the key generation service as per its conditional logic. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal since this does not affect core database or storage services, and SSH key generation can be manually triggered or resolved through configuration. Reproduction of this behavior is straightforward by removing or not generating SSH host keys prior to system boot, which will trigger the same conditional failures in systemd. The recommended resolution is to ensure SSH host keys are generated either manually via ssh-keygen or by re-running the sshd-keygen.service after verifying the conditions, thereby allowing systemd to complete the startup process without errors.

This incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Linux environments, including Oracle Exadata systems. The log messages indicate repeated failures to load configurations for transient mount units like run.mount and run-user.mount, as well as session scopes, with additional errors about failed signal transmissions due to connection issues. These errors typically arise from missing or misconfigured unit files for temporary runtime mounts, which are often non-essential and dynamically created during system operation. The likely root cause is a minor misconfiguration or a race condition during systemd's initialization of transient units, rather than a systemic failure. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal, as these mounts and scopes are not critical to core database or storage operations. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a high number of user sessions or rapid system startups where transient units are created and destroyed quickly. Recommended resolution involves verifying the systemd configuration for custom or overridden unit files and ensuring that runtime directories are properly initialized, though no urgent action is required. Supporting evidence from systemd documentation suggests that such errors are often benign and related to transient state management rather than persistent issues.

90dd80fc7ebf,scaqai03adm05,systemd,0,0.85,"Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves systemd and focuses on multiple condition failures during the boot process for dracut-related services and other system mount configurations. The log messages indicate that several kernel command line conditions and path existence checks failed for services like dracut-pre-udev.service and dracut-initqueue.service, alongside missing configuration files for sys.mount and sys-kernel.mount. These failures are typically seen in early boot stages and are often benign, resulting from dracut's initramfs environment not matching expected kernel parameters or hook scripts, which do not necessarily impact system stability or functionality post-boot. The likely root cause is a mismatch in the initramfs configuration or kernel command line parameters not being set as expected by dracut services, but this does not suggest a deeper systemic issue. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these messages are common in Oracle Linux environments during boot and do not indicate a failure of critical services. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting a system with a custom or mismatched initramfs that lacks the expected kernel command line options or hook scripts. The recommended resolution is to review the initramfs configuration and kernel boot parameters for consistency, though no immediate action is required unless other boot or operational issues are observed. Supporting evidence comes from known systemd and dracut behavior in Oracle Linux, where such condition failures are often logged but do not affect core system operation.

The incident involves systemd-udevd, a component responsible for managing device events and loading kernel modules during system initialization or device detection. The specific error message indicates a failure to open a block device at /dev/loop0, citing 'No such device or address,' which typically suggests that the loop device is either not created or not properly configured at the time of access. This issue is unlikely to impact Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability significantly, as loop devices are generally used for mounting disk images and are not critical to core database or storage cell operations. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by attempting to access a non-existent or uninitialized loop device during system boot or device hotplug events. The recommended resolution is to verify if a loop device is expected at /dev/loop0 and ensure the loop kernel module is loaded early via systemd or initramfs configuration if needed. This type of error is commonly seen in systemd-udevd logs when temporary or non-essential devices are referenced, and it does not align with known critical failure patterns in Oracle Linux or Exadata environments.

The incident involves the 'root' component with errors related to the Xen virtual interface bridge script failing to delete interfaces or bring them down, as seen in the message structure and log window. These errors typically occur during the teardown or reconfiguration of virtual network interfaces in a Xen-based virtualization environment, likely due to the interfaces already being in an unexpected state or missing at the time of execution. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these messages are often transient and do not indicate a failure of core database or storage services. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by manually invoking the vif-bridge script during a virtual machine shutdown or network reconfiguration under conditions where the target interfaces are already removed or misconfigured. Resolution may involve verifying the state of the virtual interfaces before script execution or adjusting the script to handle such edge cases gracefully. Supporting evidence suggests that such errors are common in Xen environments when network state changes occur rapidly, and they are generally not indicative of deeper systemic issues in Oracle or kernel contexts.

This incident involves the systemd component, which is critical for managing system services and units in an Oracle Linux environment, commonly used in Exadata/Exascale systems. The repeated error messages about failing to send unit remove signals due to 'transport endpoint is not connected' suggest a communication breakdown within systemd's control mechanisms, potentially indicating a socket or inter-process communication failure. This could impact system reliability by preventing proper cleanup or state transitions of units like rdma-hw.target and systemd-networkd.service, which are essential for RDMA and networking functionality. While the exact root cause is unclear without additional context, it may stem from a systemd bug, misconfiguration, or an underlying kernel issue affecting socket handling. The behavior might be reproducible under conditions of high system load or during specific service shutdown sequences, though further logs or systemd journal entries are needed to confirm. For resolution, I recommend inspecting systemd's journal for preceding errors, verifying systemd version and patches, and checking for related kernel socket issues. This issue warrants triage to determine if it poses a broader risk to system stability, especially given the involvement of RDMA and network services critical to Exadata performance.

The repeated error messages about failing to send unit remove signals due to 'Transport endpoint is not connected' suggest a communication breakdown within systemd's internal mechanisms, potentially indicating a socket or bus issue during a system state transition like shutdown or service restart. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is uncertain but could be significant if critical services like sshd or storage device units fail to transition properly, potentially leading to inaccessible services or incomplete device cleanup. Reproduction of this behavior might occur during high system load or abrupt state changes, such as forced reboots or service interruptions, though specific triggers are unclear from the log window. Without developer feedback or additional context, the root cause could range from a transient glitch to a deeper issue in systemd's handling of unit dependencies or D-Bus communication. Recommended next steps include checking for preceding errors in journalctl logs for systemd or D-Bus, verifying system state during the incident, and monitoring for recurrence during similar operations. This issue lacks clear precedent in Oracle or systemd documentation for Exadata-specific environments, necessitating further triage to rule out broader system impacts.

The incident involves the systemd component, specifically a failure to destroy a cgroup associated with the rc-oracle-exadata.service due to a 'device or resource busy' condition. This error typically occurs when systemd attempts to clean up control groups after a service has stopped, but lingering processes or resources are still tied to the cgroup, preventing its destruction. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this is a post-service cleanup issue and does not indicate a failure in the service itself or broader system instability. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by stopping the rc-oracle-exadata.service under load or with improper shutdown handling, where residual processes remain attached to the cgroup. The recommended resolution is to ensure proper service termination and, if persistent, investigate for stuck processes using tools like ps or systemd-cgtop to identify lingering resource ties.

Additionally, the device-mapper multipath messages about failing paths (e.g., 8:32, 8:176) suggest that the system is actively marking storage paths as failed, which could lead to data unavailability or degraded performance. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as this could disrupt database access or cause node eviction in a clustered environment if storage access is not restored. This behavior could potentially be reproduced by simulating a storage network interruption or inducing a hardware failure on the affected paths. Recommended resolution includes immediate checks on storage connectivity, HBA status, and multipath configuration, alongside reviewing kernel logs for preceding errors and engaging storage vendor support if hardware issues are suspected. Supporting evidence comes from known kernel behaviors under transport failures, often documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat storage troubleshooting guides, where DID_TRANSPORT_FAILFAST typically points to underlying fabric or hardware issues.

The incident involving the multipathd component indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths being marked as failed across various devices (sda through sdp) and maps (mpathc and mpathd). This behavior suggests a systemic failure in the storage subsystem, likely due to a hardware issue, misconfiguration in the multipath setup, or a failure in the underlying storage array connectivity. Such widespread path failures can lead to significant degradation in data availability and potential data loss if redundant paths are not properly configured or if failover mechanisms fail, directly impacting Exadata/Exascale reliability. This issue could potentially be reproduced by simulating a storage controller failure or disconnecting multiple paths simultaneously to observe multipathd behavior under stress. The recommended resolution includes immediate checks on the storage hardware, verification of multipath configuration files for errors, and ensuring that failover policies are correctly implemented; additionally, logs from the storage array should be reviewed for correlated errors.

This incident involves the multipathd component, which is responsible for managing multipath storage configurations in an Exadata/Exascale environment, ensuring redundancy and failover for storage paths. The repeated log entries indicating 'failing' states for multiple devices (sdc, sdl, sdn, sdp, etc.) with consistent state and dmstate values of 2 suggest a systemic issue with path availability or device mapper synchronization, likely due to underlying storage connectivity loss, misconfiguration in multipath.conf, or a failure in the storage array communication. This behavior poses a significant risk to system reliability and availability, as multipath failures can lead to inaccessible storage devices, impacting database operations and potentially causing data unavailability in an Exadata setup. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a storage path failure or disconnecting specific LUNs to observe if multipathd fails to handle the failover correctly. The recommended resolution includes immediate validation of storage connectivity, review of multipathd configuration for path policies and blacklisted devices, and checking storage array logs for errors or dropped connections, followed by restarting the multipathd service if necessary.

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where two services, chrony-wait.service and rc-oracle-exadata.service, have failed with distinct error results 'exit-code' and 'signal' respectively. The failure of chrony-wait.service suggests a potential issue with time synchronization, which is critical for distributed systems like Exadata where consistent timing across nodes is essential for operations such as clustering and logging accuracy. The failure of rc-oracle-exadata.service, which appears to be a custom service likely tied to Exadata-specific initialization, indicates a deeper issue in the system bootstrap or configuration specific to Oracle's engineered systems, potentially disrupting database or grid infrastructure startup. These failures together pose a significant risk to system reliability and availability, as they could prevent proper initialization of key Exadata components or lead to desynchronization in a cluster environment. Reproduction of this issue might involve examining the systemd service definitions for dependencies or misconfigurations, or simulating a system boot to observe if these failures recur under specific conditions like network unavailability or incorrect chrony configurations. Recommended resolution steps include inspecting the systemd journal for detailed error messages related to these services using 'journalctl -u chrony-wait.service' and 'journalctl -u rc-oracle-exadata.service', verifying chrony configuration files for correctness, and ensuring that Exadata-specific initialization scripts are properly set up. Supporting evidence for criticality comes from the systemic importance of time synchronization in Oracle RAC and Grid Infrastructure environments, where even minor discrepancies can lead to node evictions or transaction failures, alongside the tailored nature of rc-oracle-exadata.service which implies a direct impact on engineered system functionality.

This behavior can critically impact system reliability and availability, as the loss of multiple paths likely results in degraded or complete loss of access to storage resources, potentially leading to data unavailability or service outages. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a storage controller failure or disconnecting multiple paths in a test environment to observe multipathd behavior under stress. The recommended resolution includes immediate checks on the storage array status, verification of SAN fabric connectivity, and review of multipathd configuration files for errors or inconsistencies, followed by reinstatement of failed paths or failover to redundant systems if available. Supporting evidence for this assessment comes from known multipathd behavior in Oracle Linux and Red Hat documentation, where such widespread path failures are treated as critical events often tied to hardware or zoning issues in high-availability setups.

This incident involves systemd failing to manage critical system resources during a service shutdown or system state transition, specifically with the exadata-netdiag-dump.service entering a failed state alongside multiple failures in unmounting filesystems and deactivating swap spaces. The component in focus, systemd, is fundamental to system initialization and service management on Oracle Linux systems used in Exadata environments, and its failure to unmount critical paths like /var and /EXAVMIMAGES or deactivate swap indicates a severe issue, potentially related to resource contention, improper shutdown sequencing, or underlying storage issues. The root cause could stem from a misconfiguration in systemd unit files for Exadata-specific services or a failure in the storage layer preventing proper unmounting and deactivation, which disrupts normal system operation. This behavior poses a significant risk to Exadata reliability, as it can lead to data inconsistency, incomplete shutdowns, or inability to remount critical filesystems on reboot, directly impacting system availability. Reproducing this issue might involve simulating a system shutdown or service stop under load to observe if systemd fails to handle resource cleanup, particularly with Exadata-specific mounts and swap configurations. Mitigation steps include reviewing systemd unit dependencies for exadata-netdiag-dump.service, ensuring proper timeout settings, and checking for underlying storage or LVM issues that prevent unmounting or swap deactivation.

This error typically does not impact core system functionality or Exadata service availability, as power management capabilities are not critical to journaling or database operations. The repetitive nature of the log entry in the provided window indicates a persistent but non-disruptive condition, possibly tied to a misconfiguration in systemd or kernel parameters related to power management. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by running systemd-journald on a system where power management interfaces are unavailable or restricted, such as in certain virtualized environments or with specific kernel configurations.

The log window indicates that the exadata-netdiag-dump.service has entered a failed state, which is likely tied to diagnostic or network-related functionality specific to Exadata environments. Additionally, systemd failed to unmount critical filesystems like /var and /var/log, and it could not deactivate multiple swap devices, pointing to potential issues with resource release or underlying storage configuration. This behavior could severely impact system reliability by preventing proper shutdowns or restarts, potentially leading to data corruption or incomplete diagnostic data collection. The issue might be reproducible during system shutdown or when triggering the exadata-netdiag-dump.service under specific storage or network load conditions. Recommended resolution includes checking for misconfigured swap devices or filesystem mount options, reviewing systemd unit files for exadata-netdiag-dump.service dependencies, and ensuring no underlying storage or network issues are blocking resource release.

This incident involves systemd and indicates a severe issue with multiple dependency failures during system boot or initialization, affecting critical mount points and swap configurations. The log window shows repeated failures for mounts like /var/log/audit, /crashfiles, /tmp, and swap, with specific jobs timing out or failing due to dependency issues, pointing to a likely misconfiguration or unavailability of labeled disk devices. The root cause appears to be related to systemd's inability to locate or access disk devices by their labels (e.g., AUDIT, KDUMP, SWAP, TMP), which could stem from incorrect labeling, missing devices, or underlying storage issues. This behavior severely impacts system reliability and availability, as critical directories and swap space are inaccessible, potentially leading to incomplete logging, failed crash dump configurations, and degraded performance. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating a scenario where disk labels are missing or mismatched during boot, or by introducing storage latency or failures.

This incident involves systemd-logind, a core system service responsible for managing user logins and sessions in a Linux environment, often used in Oracle Linux deployments on Exadata systems. The error message 'Failed to abandon session scope: Transport endpoint is not connected' typically indicates a transient issue where systemd-logind attempted to clean up a session but encountered a disconnected or unavailable endpoint, likely due to a user session terminating unexpectedly or a network-related disruption. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as this error does not directly affect database or storage services and is often self-recovering without intervention. Reproduction of this behavior could likely occur during abrupt session terminations, such as a user disconnecting via SSH without proper logout, or during system reboots with active sessions. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if persistent, checking journalctl for related systemd-logind errors or network issues may provide additional context. Supporting evidence suggests this is a known, non-critical behavior in systemd, often documented in community forums and official documentation as a benign error under normal operation.

The impact on system reliability is high, as this can disrupt database clustering and communication between nodes, potentially causing performance degradation or service outages in Oracle RAC environments. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating high RDMA workload or inducing memory pressure on the system during InfiniBand initialization. Mitigation steps include verifying the InfiniBand driver configuration, checking for kernel parameter misconfigurations related to memory allocation, and ensuring the latest Unbreakable Enterprise Kernel (UEK) updates are applied to address potential bugs.

The incident involving the multipathd component indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths being marked as failed across different multipath maps (mpathb, mpathc, mpathd). This behavior suggests a potential underlying problem with storage connectivity, likely due to a hardware failure, misconfiguration in the multipath setup, or a SAN/network issue disrupting access to the storage devices. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as the failure of multiple paths can lead to degraded performance or complete loss of access to critical storage resources, potentially causing data unavailability or service outages. Reproduction of this issue could likely be triggered by simulating a storage disconnect or inducing failures on the SAN fabric to observe multipathd behavior under stress. Recommended resolution steps include immediate verification of physical storage connections, review of SAN switch logs for errors, and validation of multipath configuration files for correctness, followed by failover testing to ensure redundancy.

The incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, reporting multiple failures to unmount various directories and user runtime mounts during a shutdown or service stop operation. The likely technical root cause is a timing issue or dependency conflict where systemd attempts to unmount filesystems before dependent processes or services have fully terminated, resulting in 'exit-code' failures as seen in the log window. This behavior typically has minimal impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability since unmount failures during shutdown do not affect running operations and are often resolved on the next boot or manual intervention. Reproduction of this issue could occur during rapid system shutdowns or if services tied to these mount points (like Oracle Grid or database homes) are not stopped cleanly before unmount attempts. The recommended resolution is to ensure proper service stop ordering via systemd dependencies or scripts to delay unmounting until dependent processes are terminated.

The log window indicates failures in two dispatcher scripts, '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip' and '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/100-rdmasec', with one being killed by signal 10 (SIGUSR1, often indicating a forced termination) and the other exiting with status 1 (general error). These scripts are likely related to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) configuration or security, critical for high-performance networking in Exadata environments, and their failure suggests a misconfiguration or incompatibility in the network setup. The impact could be severe, potentially disrupting RDMA connectivity or network stability, which are essential for database and storage cell communication in Exadata systems. Reproduction of this issue might involve triggering network state changes (e.g., interface up or connectivity change events) while monitoring dispatcher script execution for errors or timeouts. Mitigation steps include reviewing the content and permissions of the failing scripts, ensuring they are compatible with the current NetworkManager version, and checking system logs for related RDMA or network errors. Evidence from the message structure and log window points to consistent script execution failures, and such issues are known to cause network service disruptions in Oracle Linux environments with custom dispatcher scripts. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.

The incident involving multipathd indicates a severe issue with multiple storage paths failing across different multipath maps (mpatha and mpathb), as seen in the log window with repeated 'checker failed path' messages for various path IDs. This behavior suggests a potential underlying problem with the storage subsystem, such as a SAN connectivity issue, faulty hardware, or misconfigured multipath settings, leading to the marking of devices like sdq and sds as failed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is significant, as multipath failures can result in reduced redundancy, potential data unavailability, or performance degradation if alternative paths are not available or also fail. Reproducing this issue could likely involve simulating a storage network disruption or inducing hardware faults on the affected paths to observe multipathd behavior under stress. The recommended resolution includes immediate checks on SAN connectivity, validation of multipath configuration files against Oracle best practices, and inspection of hardware logs for errors, alongside potential failover testing to ensure redundancy.

The incident involving multipathd indicates a failure in path checking for a specific path (8:160) in the map mpatha, which is a critical component of storage multipathing in Exadata/Exascale environments. The likely technical root cause is a failure or misconfiguration in the underlying storage path, possibly due to a disconnected or faulty storage device, SAN fabric issue, or incorrect multipath configuration. This failure can directly impact storage availability and reliability, potentially leading to data access interruptions or degraded performance in a high-availability system like Exadata. The behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating a path failure or disconnecting the specified path (8:160) in a test environment to observe multipathd's response. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the physical and logical connectivity of the storage path, checking SAN switch logs for errors, and reviewing multipath.conf for misconfigurations, followed by a failover test to ensure redundancy. Supporting evidence comes from known issues in device-mapper-multipath where path failures can cascade into broader storage access problems if not addressed promptly, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage administration guides.

The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the chrony-wait.service, which is responsible for ensuring time synchronization via chrony before other dependent services start. The failure of this service with an 'exit-code' result typically indicates that the service did not complete successfully, likely due to chrony not being ready or a timeout in the wait process. This issue generally has minimal impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability, as time synchronization failures in this context often self-resolve or do not affect core database or storage operations. Reproduction of this behavior could occur if chrony is misconfigured or if network issues prevent timely NTP server access during boot. The recommended resolution is to verify chrony configuration and ensure NTP servers are reachable, potentially adjusting the timeout settings for chrony-wait.service if needed. Supporting evidence suggests that such failures are common in systemd-managed environments when time sync dependencies are not met, and they are often transient as per systemd documentation and Oracle Linux guides.

The incident involves systemd, a core system service manager, reporting multiple failures to unmount various file systems during a shutdown or service operation. These failures typically occur when file systems are still in use by active processes or sessions, preventing a clean unmount, which is a common and often benign issue in Linux environments. The log window shows consistent failures across paths like /var/log/audit, /u01/app, and /home, with specific mount units failing with 'exit-code', suggesting a procedural rather than systemic failure. The likely root cause is lingering user sessions or open file handles, which do not indicate a critical failure in systemd itself but rather an operational state issue at the time of unmounting. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these errors are generally transient and resolved on subsequent attempts or reboots. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during a system shutdown while user processes or services remain active on the affected mounts. The recommended resolution is to ensure all user sessions are terminated and services stopped before unmounting, potentially using 'fuser' or 'lsof' to identify and kill blocking processes. There are no strong indicators of a deeper bug or failure in the logs provided, and such unmount failures are well-documented in systemd contexts as non-critical unless accompanied by broader system instability.

The incident involving multipathd indicates a recurring failure in path information retrieval following change uevents for multiple storage paths (sda, sdc, sdd, sde), as seen in the log window with repeated error messages. This component, multipathd, is critical for managing storage path redundancy and failover in Exadata/Exascale environments, and the failure to update path information likely stems from a misconfiguration in the multipath configuration file, a kernel-level issue with uevent processing, or underlying storage hardware connectivity problems. Such errors can severely impact system reliability by preventing proper failover or load balancing across storage paths, potentially leading to data access interruptions or performance degradation. This behavior could likely be reproduced by simulating storage path changes or failures under load, or by intentionally misconfiguring multipathd settings to ignore certain paths or events. To mitigate this, immediate steps should include verifying the multipath.conf settings for correct path policies and blacklists, checking dmesg for related kernel errors, and inspecting physical storage connections or SAN configurations for faults.

The incident involves systemd-logind, a component responsible for managing user logins and sessions in a Linux environment, often used in Oracle Linux systems underpinning Exadata/Exascale. The log messages indicate a failure to start a user service and session scope due to a destructive transaction conflict, likely caused by a mismatch in job queuing states (start vs. stop) for dependent units like mounts or targets. This behavior typically arises during system state transitions, such as shutdown or user session termination, where systemd encounters conflicting operations, but it does not generally impact core system stability or Exadata-specific services. The impact on reliability or availability is minimal, as systemd-logind issues of this nature are often transient and self-resolving, with the system explicitly 'ignoring' the failure as noted in the logs. Reproduction could likely be achieved by initiating a user session start while a related mount or target unit is in a stop or umount state, though this is situational and not indicative of a deeper flaw. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence and ensure proper systemd unit dependencies are configured to avoid such conflicts, though no immediate action is required. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and community discussions on transaction conflicts, which classify these as non-critical errors in most operational contexts.

The incident involves the nm-dispatcher component, which is part of NetworkManager and responsible for executing dispatcher scripts during network state changes. The log window indicates failures in two scripts, '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/99-rdmaip' and '/etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/100-rdmasec', with one being killed by signal 10 (SIGUSR1, often indicative of a forced termination) and the other exiting with status 1 (general error). These scripts are likely related to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) configuration or security, critical for high-performance networking in Exadata/Exascale environments, and their failure could disrupt network connectivity or RDMA functionality. The potential impact includes degraded performance or complete loss of RDMA-based communication, affecting database operations or cluster interconnects. Reproduction of this issue could likely be achieved by simulating network state changes (e.g., interface up or connectivity change events) and observing script execution behavior. Recommended resolution steps include inspecting the named scripts for errors, verifying permissions and environment variables, and checking for recent configuration changes or updates to NetworkManager that might have introduced incompatibilities. Supporting evidence comes from the explicit failure messages in the log window and the critical nature of RDMA in Oracle engineered systems, where network stability is paramount.

This incident involves systemd-logind, a component responsible for managing user logins and sessions in a Linux environment, often critical in multi-user systems but less so in Exadata's typical appliance-like usage. The log messages indicate a failure to start a user service and session scope due to a destructive transaction conflict, likely triggered by a system state change or shutdown operation interfering with session initialization. The root cause appears to be a timing issue or misconfiguration in systemd's transaction handling, where conflicting start and stop operations are queued, but this does not suggest a deeper failure in the Exadata stack or core services. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal, as systemd-logind issues typically do not affect database or storage cell operations unless tied to administrative access, which is not evident here. Reproduction could likely occur during a system shutdown or reboot with active user sessions, especially if custom systemd units or swap configurations are involved. The recommended resolution is to review systemd configuration for custom units or dependencies that might conflict during state transitions, and if persistent, consider adjusting session timeout policies or logging levels to suppress such warnings. Evidence from the log window shows specific transaction conflicts with user@1000.service and session-c26.scope, which are standard systemd behaviors during shutdown or resource contention, and no critical system impact is implied based on known systemd precedents.

The incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, where multiple failures are reported during service shutdown or unmounting operations. The specific errors relate to chrony-wait.service failing with an exit-code result and failed unmounting of user runtime directories and audit logs, which typically occur during system shutdown or user session termination. These failures are often transient and related to timing issues or incomplete cleanup of mount points rather than indicative of a deeper systemic problem. The likely root cause is a race condition or improper dependency handling in systemd unit files, which does not generally impact overall system reliability or availability in Exadata/Exascale environments. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating rapid system shutdowns or user logouts under load to observe unmounting failures. The recommended resolution is to review systemd unit dependencies for chrony-wait.service and associated mount units, ensuring proper ordering and timeout configurations, though immediate action is not required as operational impact appears minimal.
