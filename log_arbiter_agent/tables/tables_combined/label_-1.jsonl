The incident involves the systemd component, specifically the failure of the systemd-fstab-generator with an exit status of 1, indicating an error during the processing of filesystem table configurations. This generator is responsible for creating mount units based on /etc/fstab entries during system boot, and a failure could point to misconfigurations in the fstab file, syntax errors, or unsupported options that systemd cannot parse. The potential impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability is uncertain but could be significant if critical filesystems fail to mount, potentially disrupting database or grid infrastructure services reliant on those mounts. Reproduction of this issue might involve intentionally introducing an invalid entry in /etc/fstab (e.g., incorrect device path or mount options) and rebooting the system to observe if the generator fails again. Given the lack of developer feedback and specific context in the log window, it is challenging to determine if this is a one-off error or a systemic issue requiring deeper investigation. The recommended step is to inspect /etc/fstab for errors, verify mount points, and check journalctl logs for additional context on the failure.

The incident involves systemd-networkd, a critical component responsible for managing network configurations in modern Linux distributions, including Oracle Linux used in Exadata environments. The error message 'Event loop failed: Transport endpoint is not connected' suggests a potential disruption in the network service's ability to maintain connections, which could stem from underlying network stack issues, socket closures, or misconfigurations in the networkd service. This type of failure might impact network availability or reliability on the Exadata system, potentially affecting communication between nodes or with external services if persistent. Reproduction could likely be attempted by simulating network interruptions or socket failures during high load or failover scenarios to observe if systemd-networkd handles the event loop failure gracefully. Given the lack of developer feedback and limited context in the log window, it is challenging to definitively classify this as critical or ignorable without additional logs or system state information. A recommended next step is to investigate related journalctl logs for systemd-networkd and check network interface status to identify any preceding errors or warnings that might indicate the root cause. This issue needs triage to determine if it represents a transient glitch or a deeper systemic problem, potentially drawing on known systemd behaviors documented in Oracle Linux and freedesktop resources.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/ - Oracle Linux systemd documentation;https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/ - RHEL systemd troubleshooting", "log_window": "systemd-networkd: Event loop failed: Transport endpoint is not connected", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 2, "message_structure": "systemd-networkd: event loop failed: transport endpoint is not connected", "k0_sim": 0.5176948308944702, "i0_sim": 0.4886517226696014}
{"incident_id": "f756bf4bd8be", "host": "scaqae03adm06", "component": "systemd", "label": -1, "confidence": 0.75, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Unclear. This incident involves the systemd component, which is critical for system initialization and service management in Oracle Linux environments. The log window shows a large number of 'Failed to load configuration' errors for various mount points and services, including critical ones like oracle-ohasd.service and ohasd.service, alongside errors like 'Connection reset by peer' for systemd-logind.service and sshd.service. The root cause likely stems from missing or corrupted systemd unit files, possibly due to a misconfiguration, incomplete system update, or filesystem issues during boot. While these errors could impact system reliability by preventing essential services from starting, it is unclear without additional context whether this is a transient issue during boot or a persistent failure affecting Exadata availability. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating a system update or manually removing systemd configuration files to observe boot behavior. Recommended steps include verifying the integrity of systemd unit files in /etc/systemd and /usr/lib/systemd, checking for recent system changes, and reviewing journalctl logs for preceding errors. The involvement of Exadata-specific services like ohasd in the error list raises concerns about potential impacts on cluster services. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

This pattern of repeated failures across multiple paths is concerning and aligns with known issues in device-mapper multipath under certain conditions, as documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage troubleshooting guides.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/dm_multipath/troubleshooting", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/7/storage-admin/ol7-multipath.html - Oracle Linux multipath setup and issues;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-uevent.html - Kernel documentation on uevent handling in device-mapper", "log_window": "multipathd: sda: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sdd: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sdc: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sde: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sda: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sdd: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sde: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sdc: pathinfo failed after change uevent", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 8, "message_structure": "multipathd: sda: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sdd: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sdc: pathinfo failed after change uevent\nmultipathd: sde: pathinfo failed after change uevent", "k0_sim": 0.3572821021080017, "i0_sim": 0.3390769958496094}
{"incident_id": "2aec7f0daaab", "host": "scaqat10v6adm04", "component": "exachkcfg", "label": -1, "confidence": 0.75, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Unclear. This incident involves the exachkcfg component on an Exadata system, where sshd is repeatedly failing to bind to port 22 on multiple IP addresses, both IPv4 and IPv6, with the error 'Cannot assign requested address.' The likely technical root cause is a network configuration issue, such as the specified IP addresses not being assigned to the host, or a conflict with another process already binding to the port. This could impact Exadata reliability by preventing secure shell access for administrative tasks or automated checks, potentially disrupting management operations. Reproducing this behavior might involve intentionally misconfiguring the network interfaces or binding another service to port 22 on the affected IPs. Recommended resolution steps include verifying the network configuration, ensuring the IPs are correctly assigned to the host, and checking for port conflicts using tools like netstat or ss. Evidence from the log window shows consistent failures across multiple IPs, suggesting a systemic configuration issue rather than a transient error. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://support.oracle.com/", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/engineered-systems/exadata-database-machine/ - Exadata network configuration documentation;https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/ - Oracle Linux networking guide;https://serverfault.com/questions/40712/what-causes-the-error-cannot-assign-requested-address - Community discussion on bind errors", "log_window": "exachkcfg: Nov 05 09:53:29 scaqat10v6adm04.us.oracle.com sshd[110792]: error: Bind to port 22 on 192.197.252.39 failed: Cannot assign requested address.\nexachkcfg: Nov 05 09:53:29 scaqat10v6adm04.us.oracle.com sshd[110792]: error: Bind to port 22 on 192.197.252.38 failed: Cannot assign requested address.\nexachkcfg: Nov 05 09:53:29 scaqat10v6adm04.us.oracle.com sshd[110792]: error: Bind to port 22 on 2606:b400:418:a2c0::2a failed: Cannot assign requested address.", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 3, "message_structure": "exachkcfg: nov <num> <time> scaqat<num>v<num>adm<num>.us.oracle.com sshd[<num>]: error: bind to port <num> on <ip> failed: cannot assign requested address.\nexachkcfg: nov <num> <time> scaqat<num>v<num>adm<num>.us.oracle.com sshd[<num>]: error: bind to port <num> on <num>:b<num>:<num>:a<num>c<num>::<num>a failed: cannot assign requested address.", "k0_sim": 0.3845062255859375, "i0_sim": 0.41073739528656}
