However, these failures are typically non-impacting as dracut-pre-udev.service is part of the early boot process and such condition failures do not necessarily prevent the system from booting or functioning correctly unless explicitly required by the system configuration. The likely root cause is a mismatch between the expected kernel parameters in the systemd service configuration and the actual kernel command line provided during boot, which could stem from a default or customized bootloader configuration.

The recommended resolution is to verify if the missing configurations are intentional or required; if not, these messages can be safely ignored, or systemd can be updated to suppress non-critical warnings. Supporting evidence comes from systemd documentation and Oracle Linux practices, where such messages are often benign unless accompanied by actual service failures or dependency issues, which are not evident in the provided log window.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/", "additional_sources":

The incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during the system initialization or a systemd reload operation. The likely root cause is that these unit files are either not present on the system or are being referenced incorrectly due to a misconfiguration in the systemd presets or drop-in files, which is common in customized or minimal installations of Oracle Linux on Exadata systems. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors typically do not prevent core system functionality or critical services from starting, especially since essential mounts and services like oracle-ohasd.service are often managed separately in Exadata environments. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by performing a systemd daemon-reload or system boot on a system with missing or misconfigured unit files. As a resolution, it is recommended to review the systemd configuration and preset files to ensure only necessary units are enabled, and to suppress non-critical errors by adjusting the systemd log level if they do not impact operations.

This incident involves systemd failing to load configuration files for several mount units related to /var and its subdirectories, as well as a connection reset error for unbound-anchor.timer. The root cause appears to be missing configuration files for the specified mount units, which are likely not critical to system operation or Exadata/Exascale functionality, as these paths are standard but not always required to be explicitly defined in systemd.

Reproduction of this behavior could occur if systemd attempts to load mount units for non-existent or misconfigured paths during boot or service reload. The recommended resolution is to verify whether these mount units are intentionally defined or required; if not, they can be safely ignored or masked to prevent recurring log noise.

This incident involves the systemd component, where a large number of configuration files for various mount points and services are reported as missing with 'No such file or directory' errors. The likely root cause is that these configuration files are either not required for the current system setup or were removed or not generated during system initialization, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux installations on Exadata systems. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as these messages typically occur during boot when systemd attempts to load configurations for non-essential or non-existent services and mount points, without evidence of actual service failure or operational disruption in the log window. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a stripped-down systemd configuration or after a system update that removes unused unit files. The recommended resolution is to verify if the missing configurations are expected in the current environment and, if not needed, suppress these warnings by masking unnecessary units via 'systemctl mask' for clarity in logs.

The incident involves systemd, a core system and service manager in Linux environments, including Oracle Exadata systems. The log messages indicate failures to load configurations for temporary mount units like run.mount and run-user.mount, as well as session scopes such as session-233.scope, with errors stating 'No such file or directory' and inability to abandon non-running scopes. These errors typically arise from missing or misconfigured unit files for transient or user-specific scopes, which are often created dynamically and may not persist across reboots or sessions. The likely root cause is benign, stemming from systemd attempting to manage units that have been cleaned up or never properly initialized, which does not indicate a systemic failure or misconfiguration requiring immediate intervention. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal, as these units are not critical to core database or storage operations. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during user session terminations or system cleanup processes where temporary units are removed before systemd can process related messages. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence or associated user session issues, but no immediate action is required beyond logging for future reference.

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically a failure to send a unit change signal for crond.service due to a 'Connection reset by peer' error. The likely technical root cause is a transient communication issue between systemd and the crond.service, possibly due to a temporary socket closure or network interruption, which is not uncommon in distributed systems under load. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as this error typically does not affect the core functionality of crond.service or systemd itself, and crond tasks are likely to continue running unaffected. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating high system load or network disruptions while systemd attempts to communicate with dependent services. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if the issue persists, restarting systemd or investigating socket configurations may be warranted. Supporting evidence suggests that such errors are often transient and benign in systemd environments, as documented in various Linux system administration resources.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/", "additional_sources": "https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/managing_system_services_with_systemd/index - systemd troubleshooting;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/systemctl.1.html - systemctl man page for signal handling", "log_window": "systemd: Failed to send unit change signal for crond.service: Connection reset by peer", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 1, "message_structure": "systemd: failed to send unit change signal for crond.service: connection reset by peer", "k0_sim": 0.5200933814048767, "i0_sim": 0.4406002163887024}

This incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, reporting multiple 'failed to load configuration' errors for various mount points and services during system boot or initialization. The likely root cause is that these configuration files or units are either missing, not installed, or not required for the specific system configuration, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux environments on Exadata systems where not all systemd units are needed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears negligible, as these messages typically do not indicate a failure of critical system components or services but rather an attempt by systemd to load optional or non-existent configurations. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting a system with a similar minimal or customized systemd configuration where certain unit files are absent. The recommended resolution is to ignore these messages unless they correlate with actual service failures or system instability, and if necessary, verify the systemd configuration for missing or misconfigured units using 'systemctl' commands. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior documented in Oracle Linux and Red Hat resources, where such messages are often benign during boot when optional services or mounts are not

The incident involves the systemd component, where numerous log entries indicate a failure to load configuration files for various mount points and services due to 'No such file or directory' errors. This behavior is often seen during the early boot phase or in minimal environments where systemd attempts to load configurations for units that are not present or relevant to the current system setup, especially in specialized systems like Exadata. The likely root cause is the absence of expected configuration files or directories, which does not necessarily indicate a misconfiguration but rather a mismatch between systemd's default expectations and the tailored Exadata environment. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors do not point to active service failures or critical system components being affected. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting an Exadata system with a minimal or customized configuration where systemd unit files are not fully populated. As a resolution, these messages can generally be ignored unless associated with specific service failures; if needed, systemd units can be masked or customized to suppress irrelevant errors. Supporting evidence includes the repetitive nature of the 'No such file or directory' errors across a wide range of non-critical mount points and services, consistent with harmless systemd noise

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically the systemd-binfmt.service, which is responsible for registering binary formats for execution in the kernel. The log messages indicate that the condition checks for non-empty directories at /run/binfmt.d and /usr/local/lib/binfmt.d failed, meaning these directories are either empty or do not exist, preventing the service from starting. This is not a critical issue as systemd-binfmt.service is an optional component typically used for running binaries in foreign architectures, and its absence does not impact core system functionality or Exadata/Exascale operations. The potential impact on reliability or availability is negligible since most Oracle environments do not rely on custom binary format registrations. Reproduction of this behavior is straightforward by ensuring the specified directories are empty or non-existent during system boot or service start. The recommended resolution is to ignore this message unless specific use cases require binary format support, in which case the directories should be populated with appropriate configuration files.

The likely root cause appears to be a misconfiguration or absence of expected unit files during a systemd initialization or reload operation, possibly triggered by a system update, custom configuration, or an incomplete installation. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as these messages typically reflect systemd's attempt to process non-existent or misconfigured units without evidence of actual service disruption or failure in the provided log window. Reproduction of this behavior could likely be achieved by intentionally removing or misconfiguring systemd unit files and then triggering a systemctl daemon-reload or system boot. Resolution steps include verifying the presence and correctness of systemd unit files in /etc/systemd/system or /lib/systemd/system, and ensuring that any custom configurations align with the system's expected setup.

This issue typically arises due to missing or incomplete udev rules, incorrect device naming, or unsupported interface types by NetworkManager, and does not directly imply a failure in network functionality or connectivity. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as core networking services are often managed by lower-level components or custom configurations outside NetworkManager's scope.

The log message 'sdj: mark as failed' indicates that a single path to a storage device has been marked as failed, which is a common occurrence in multipath environments when a path becomes unavailable due to transient issues like cable disconnects or temporary controller unavailability. This does not necessarily imply a critical failure, as multipathd is designed to handle such events by rerouting I/O through alternate paths, ensuring continued availability. The potential impact on Exadata reliability or availability is minimal unless all paths to the device fail, which is not indicated in the provided log window. Reproducing this behavior could involve simulating a path failure by disconnecting a storage cable or disabling a controller port, though this is not recommended in a production environment. The recommended resolution is to monitor the system for additional path failures and verify the status of the multipath configuration using 'multipath -ll' to ensure other paths are active; if the issue persists, investigate hardware or connectivity issues on the affected path.

This behavior is likely part of normal link redundancy or recovery mechanisms within the RDMA stack, and there is no evidence in the log window of associated errors, crashes, or service disruptions. The potential impact on system reliability or availability appears minimal, as failback operations are designed to maintain connectivity. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating link state changes or network interruptions on the RDMA interfaces, though it is not necessary given the non-critical nature. The recommended action is to monitor for recurrence or related errors in subsequent logs, with no immediate mitigation required. This assessment aligns with typical RDMA link monitoring behavior as documented in Oracle Exadata networking contexts.

{"incident_id": "9f459a3e6965", "host": "scaqae03adm05", "component": "systemd", "label": 0, "confidence": 0.85, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during system initialization or operation. The likely root cause is that these configuration files are either not required for the current system setup or are remnants of a generator or template that systemd attempts to load by default but are not present in this specific Exadata environment. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability appears minimal, as these messages are typically benign and do not indicate active failures of critical services or mounts\u2014core system functionality is likely unaffected based on the absence of follow-up errors or crashes in the log window. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during system boot or when systemd reloads its configuration, especially if the system has been customized or if certain packages or services are not installed. The recommended resolution is to suppress these messages by masking unnecessary units or ensuring that systemd does not attempt to load irrelevant configurations, potentially through adjustment of systemd presets or by cleaning up stale generator outputs. Supporting evidence comes from common systemd behavior on Oracle Linux and Red Hat-based systems, where such messages are often seen in minimal or specialized configurations without operational impact, as documented in systemd troubleshooting guides.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/",

This incident involves the systemd component on an Exadata system, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during system initialization or a systemd reload operation. The likely root cause is that these configuration files were either never created, were removed, or are not required for the specific system configuration, which is common in minimal or customized Oracle Linux installations on Exadata systems. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability appears negligible since these errors typically do not prevent core system functionality or critical services from starting, especially as key Exadata components like cellsrv or ohasd are not directly implicated in a failure state within the log window. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during system boot or after a 'systemctl daemon-reload' command if the expected configuration files are absent or if systemd is scanning for units that are not applicable to the environment.

This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous log entries report failures to load configurations for a wide array of services and mount points, including autofs.service, various disk and filesystem mounts, and even Exadata-specific entries like oracle-ohasd.service. The likely technical root cause is that these units or configuration files are either not installed, not present on the system, or are being referenced incorrectly during a systemd operation such as a reload or re-exec, which is a common occurrence during system initialization or updates on Oracle Linux systems used in Exadata environments. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these messages typically do not indicate an active failure of running services but rather an inability to locate configurations for optional or non-essential units that may not be required for core functionality. Reproducing this behavior could likely be achieved by triggering a systemd daemon-reload or system boot on a system where certain packages or configurations are missing or misconfigured. The recommended resolution is to verify if these services or mounts are intended to be present; if not, these messages can be safely ignored, or alternatively, suppress such warnings by masking unnecessary units via systemctl mask to prevent cluttering logs.

This incident involves a systemd error related to the firewalld.service unit, where a 'connection reset by peer' message was logged during an attempt to send a unit remove signal. The error suggests a transient communication issue between systemd and the firewalld service, likely due to the service already terminating or a socket closure before the signal could be processed. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal, as firewalld.service is not a core component of the database or storage stack, and this error does not indicate a broader systemic failure. Reproduction of this behavior could occur during rapid service restarts or system shutdowns when systemd attempts to manage units that are no longer responsive. The recommended resolution is to monitor for recurrence; if persistent, check systemd and firewalld logs for underlying socket or timing issues, though no immediate action is required. This assessment is supported by known systemd behavior in handling transient connection errors, as documented in official resources, which often classify such messages as non-impacting unless accompanied by service failures.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/ - Oracle Linux systemd configuration reference;https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/ - RHEL systemd troubleshooting guide", "log_window": "systemd: Failed to send unit remove signal for firewalld.service: Connection reset by peer", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 1, "message_structure": "systemd: failed to send unit remove signal for firewalld.service: connection reset by peer", "k0_sim": 0.5487833023071289, "i0_sim": 0.4782998561859131}

Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a minimal or misconfigured systemd setup where expected configuration files are absent. As a resolution, I recommend verifying the systemd configuration against Oracle's Exadata deployment guidelines to ensure only necessary services and mounts are defined, and suppressing or masking irrelevant units via systemctl if needed.

{"incident_id": "4e7626246ea5", "host": "scaqae03adm06", "component": "systemd", "label": 0, "confidence": 0.85, "reason": "Severity Assessment: Non-Critical. The incident involves systemd, a core system initialization and service management component, reporting numerous failures to load configuration files for various mount points and services during system boot or operation. These errors, characterized by 'No such file or directory' messages across a wide range of mount units and services like oracle-ohasd.service and ohasd.service, typically indicate that systemd is attempting to load configuration for units that are not present or not applicable in the current system configuration, often due to a minimal or customized installation. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration or absence of expected unit files in a tailored Exadata environment, where not all standard systemd units are deployed or required. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors do not suggest active service failures or operational disruptions but rather reflect systemd's verbose logging of non-critical missing configurations. Reproducing this behavior would involve booting an Exadata system with a stripped-down or non-standard set of systemd unit files, which is common in specialized environments. The recommended resolution is to review the systemd configuration and suppress these warnings by masking unnecessary units or adjusting log levels if they are not relevant to the system's role. Supporting evidence comes from systemd's known behavior of logging such errors harmlessly when expected configurations are absent, as documented in Oracle Linux and systemd upstream resources. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]",

This incident involves the systemd component, where numerous configuration files for mounts and services are reported as missing during system initialization or operation. The likely technical root cause is that these configuration files are either not required for the current system setup or are remnants of a template or automated configuration process that did not clean up unused entries. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability appears minimal, as these errors typically do not prevent core system functionality or critical services from starting, especially since no operational failures or dependency issues are evident in the log window. Reproducing this behavior could involve booting a system with a similar configuration or manually removing referenced configuration files to observe systemd's response. The recommended resolution is to review the systemd configuration and remove or suppress warnings for unnecessary or obsolete units to reduce log noise, potentially using systemctl mask or by adjusting the system configuration scripts.

This incident involves systemd and focuses on multiple condition failures during the boot process for dracut-related services and other systemd units. The log messages indicate that various kernel command line parameters and path existence checks failed for services like dracut-pre-udev.service and dracut-initqueue.service, which are part of the early boot initialization in Oracle Linux or similar environments. Additionally, configuration files for sys.mount and sys-kernel.mount could not be loaded, likely due to missing or misconfigured unit files.

The incident involves NetworkManager, a standard networking configuration service, reporting warnings about missing IPv4 addresses in the configuration files for InfiniBand interfaces (ib0 and ib1) under /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/. The likely root cause is a misconfiguration in the ifcfg files where the 'method=manual' setting requires explicit IP address definitions, which are absent, triggering these warnings during the loading process. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is minimal as these are non-fatal warnings and do not indicate a service failure or operational disruption, assuming fallback or alternative configurations are in place.

Supporting evidence comes from known systemd behavior documented in official resources, where such transaction errors are often transient and non-impacting unless paired with broader system instability.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/ - Oracle Linux systemd configurations;https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/ - RHEL systemd troubleshooting;https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/systemd-logind.8.html - systemd-logind man page", "log_window": "systemd-logind: Failed to start user service 'user@1000.service', ignoring: Transaction for user@1000.service/start is destructive (lvm2-monitor.service has 'stop' job queued, but 'start' is included in transaction).\nsystemd-logind: Failed to start session scope session-c26.scope: Transaction for session-c26.scope/start is destructive (home.mount has 'stop' job queued, but 'start' is included in transaction).", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 2, "message_structure": "systemd-logind: failed to start user service '<str>', ignoring: transaction for user@<num>.service/start is destructive (lvm<num>-monitor.service has '<str>' job queued, but '<str>' is included in transaction).\nsystemd-logind: failed to start session scope session-c<num>.scope: transaction for session-c<num>.scope/start is destructive (home.mount has '<str>' job queued, but '<str>' is included in transaction).", "k0_sim": 0.4784226417541504, "i0_sim": 0.4966524839401245}

This incident involves the exachkcfg component on an Exadata system, specifically highlighting an SSH authentication failure for the root user from a specific IPv6 address as captured in the log window. The likely technical root cause is a misconfiguration or unauthorized access attempt using an invalid or mismatched public key, which is a common occurrence in SSH logs and does not necessarily indicate a deeper systemic issue with Exadata functionality. The impact on Exadata reliability or availability is negligible since this is an isolated authentication failure and does not affect core database or storage services. Reproducing this behavior would involve attempting SSH access with an incorrect or unauthorized key for the root user from the specified IP address. The recommended resolution is to review SSH access policies, ensure proper key management, and potentially block the offending IP if it is determined to be malicious, though no immediate action is required for system stability. Supporting evidence comes from the normalized message structure showing a failed publickey attempt, a pattern often seen in routine SSH logs without broader impact, and aligns with general Oracle Linux security logging practices. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://support.oracle.com/", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/engineered-systems/exadata-database-machine/ - Exadata documentation for SSH configurations;https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/ - Oracle Linux security and SSH logging;https://blogs.oracle.com/exadata/ - Community insights on Exadata security practices", "log_window": "exachkcfg: Nov 05 04:57:57 scaqap19v6celadm06.us.oracle.com sshd[16239]: Failed publickey for root from 2606:b400:418:1a41::1fa port 59232 ssh2: RSA SHA256:E81nS5EW/ChfhQ+l5Cv9Kxpk09WSQ5Cm+he54VnhiBU", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 1, "message_structure": "exachkcfg: nov <num> <time> scaqap<num>v<num>celadm<num>.us.oracle.com sshd[<num>]: failed publickey for root from <num>:b<num>:<num>:<num>a<num>::<num>fa port <num> ssh<num>: rsa sha<num>:e<num>ns<num>ew/chfhq+l<num>cv<num>kxpk<num>wsq<num>cm+he<num>vnhibu", "k0_sim": 0.3722306489944458, "i0_sim": 0.3601324558258056}
