This type of failure can impact Exadata system availability, as the rc-oracle-exadata-zero.service may be responsible for critical initialization tasks necessary for database or storage cell operations. Such behavior could be reproduced by simulating a forced termination of the service during startup or by introducing a conflicting configuration in the service file. To mitigate this, I recommend inspecting the service definition for errors, checking journalctl logs for preceding events, and verifying dependency chains to ensure proper sequencing of Exadata services. Supporting evidence for criticality comes from the nature of systemd failures with 'signal' results, which often correlate with operational disruptions in Oracle environments, particularly when tied to custom Exadata services.

The incident pertains to the 'celld' component, a core Exadata service responsible for managing cell operations and communication. The error message indicates a failure in starting CELLSRV services due to the absence of a configured cell interconnect, which is essential for communication between storage cells and database nodes. This misconfiguration likely stems from an incomplete or incorrect setup during the 'CREATE CELL' or 'ALTER CELL' command execution, where the INTERCONNECT1 parameter was not defined with a valid network interface. The impact on Exadata reliability and availability is severe, as the lack of interconnect configuration prevents the cell from functioning within the cluster, potentially leading to storage access failures or complete service unavailability. This behavior can likely be reproduced by attempting to start CELLSRV on a cell where interconnect parameters are not set in the configuration. The recommended resolution is to update the cell configuration using the 'ALTER CELL' command to specify a valid network interface for INTERCONNECT1 and then restart the CELLSRV services. Supporting evidence comes from Oracle Exadata documentation, which mandates interconnect configuration for proper cell operation, and similar issues have been documented in My Oracle Support notes for misconfigured Exadata environments. This incident involves an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and should be reviewed by development for confirmation or deeper triage.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://support.oracle.com/", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/engineered-systems/exadata-database-machine/ - Official Exadata documentation on cell configuration;https://blogs.oracle.com/exadata/ - Insights on common Exadata configuration issues;https://community.oracle.com/ - Community discussions on CELLSRV startup errors", "log_window": "celld: CELL-00201: CELLSRV services STARTUP failed.
