The incident involves the multipath component, which is critical for storage path management in Exadata/Exascale environments, and the repeated failure to look up multiple device identifiers with type 1 suggests a potential issue with device recognition or udev integration. The root cause could be a misconfiguration in the multipathd service, outdated udev rules, or a transient issue with device detection during a rescan or reboot, though without developer feedback or additional context, the exact trigger remains speculative. The impact on system reliability could be significant if these failures prevent proper multipath device mapping, potentially leading to storage access issues or degraded redundancy, especially in a high-availability setup like Exadata. Reproduction might involve simulating a storage device rescan or reboot under similar conditions to observe if udev consistently fails to resolve these device IDs. Recommended steps include verifying multipathd configuration, checking udev logs for related errors, and ensuring the latest kernel and storage patches are applied to rule out known bugs. Supporting evidence comes from similar issues documented in Red Hat and Oracle Linux storage guides, where udev lookup failures often correlate with multipath mapping issues during dynamic device changes.\n\n[Note: reason had fewer than 5 required sentences.]", "evidence": "https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/storage_administration_guide/ch-multipath", "additional_sources": "https://docs.oracle.com/en/operating-systems/oracle-linux/8/storadm-multipath/index.html - Oracle Linux multipath guide;https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/device-mapper/dm-multipath.html - Kernel documentation on multipath", "log_window": "multipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:64 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:112 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:160 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:208 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 65:0 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:32 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:80 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:128 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:176 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:224 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:48 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:144 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:192 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:240 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 65:32 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 8:64 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 65:0 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 65:128 with type 1\nmultipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up 65:96 with type 1", "dev_feedback": "nan", "message_count": 948, "message_structure": "multipath: get_udev_device: failed to look up <num>:<num> with type <num>", "k0_sim": 0.4292535185813904, "i0_sim": 0.4465277791023254}

This incident involves the systemd component, specifically related to session scope management for user root, where multiple session scopes (1, 2, 3, and 4) are failing to start due to an inability to add PIDs to the scope's control group with the error 'No such process' and result 'resources'. The likely technical root cause could be a misconfiguration in systemd's cgroup handling or a resource limitation issue, potentially tied to kernel parameters or systemd configuration files not aligning with the system's resource availability. The impact on Exadata/Exascale reliability or availability is uncertain but could be significant if these session failures disrupt critical services or user access, especially for root-level operations. Reproducing this behavior might involve simulating high session creation load or intentionally misconfiguring cgroup settings to observe similar failures. Given the lack of developer feedback and the ambiguity of the root cause, I recommend further triage to investigate systemd configuration, kernel logs for cgroup-related errors, and resource utilization at the time of the incident.

This incident involves the nm-dispatcher component, which is part of NetworkManager and handles network event scripts in an Exadata/Exascale environment. The log window shows repeated failures of dispatcher scripts related to RDMA (Remote Direct Memory Access) configurations, specifically '100-rdmasec' and '99-rdmaip', with exit status 1 and termination by signal 10, suggesting potential issues in script execution or environmental misconfiguration. The impact on system reliability could be significant if these scripts are critical for maintaining RDMA connectivity or security settings, potentially leading to network isolation or performance degradation in a distributed system. Reproduction might involve triggering connectivity changes or interface state transitions (e.g., 'up' events) to observe if the scripts consistently fail under similar conditions. Given the lack of developer feedback, it is uncertain whether this is a known issue or a one-off error, necessitating further triage to inspect the scripts' content, permissions, and dependencies. A recommended next step is to analyze the failing scripts in /etc/NetworkManager/dispatcher.d/ for syntax errors or incorrect assumptions about the runtime environment. Additionally, checking system logs for related NetworkManager or RDMA stack errors could provide context on whether this is an isolated script issue or part of a broader networking problem.
