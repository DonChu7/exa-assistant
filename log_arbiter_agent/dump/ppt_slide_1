=== LLM Arbiter Result ===
LLM label : 0
Reason    : Severity Assessment: Non-Critical – The logs indicate that the dbus-daemon is attempting to activate the 'dbus-org.freedesktop.nm-dispatcher.service' via systemd but is unable to find the unit, resulting in repeated failure messages. This suggests that the NetworkManager dispatcher service is not installed or enabled on the system. The NetworkManager dispatcher is responsible for executing scripts in response to network state changes, and its absence may lead to certain network-related scripts not being executed. However, this does not necessarily impact the overall functionality of NetworkManager or the system's network connectivity. To resolve this issue, ensure that the NetworkManager-dispatcher package is installed and the service is enabled and started. This can typically be achieved by running 'systemctl enable --now NetworkManager-dispatcher.service' on systems using systemd. This incident does not involve an Exadata/Exascale-specific component and does not require review by development for confirmation or deeper triage.
