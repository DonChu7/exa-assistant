=== LLM Arbiter Result ===
LLM label : -1
Reason : 1. Severity Assessment: 1. 2. Context Interpretation: Severity Assessment: Unclear; the log indicates an SSH service binding failure, but without further context, it's uncertain if this is a transient issue or a critical fault. 3. Technical Root Cause Hypothesis: 2. 4. Impact Analysis: Context Interpretation: The SSH daemon (sshd) on 'scaqat02adm01' attempted to bind to port 22 on IP address 10.214.194.173 but failed with the error 'Cannot assign requested address.' This suggests a problem with the network configuration or availability of the specified IP address. 5. Reproduction Steps: 3. 6. Resolution / Mitigation Steps: Technical Root Cause Hypothesis: Potential causes include the IP address 10.214.194.173 being unassigned on any network interface, a misconfigured network interface, or a firewall blocking the binding. 7. Supporting Evidence / Precedent: 4. 8. Additional Observations: Impact Analysis: If the SSH service cannot bind to port 22 on the specified IP address, remote SSH access to the server would be unavailable, potentially affecting administrative tasks and automation processes. 9. Additional Detail 9: 5. 10. Additional Detail 10: Reproduction Steps: To reproduce, configure a server with an unassigned IP address on a network interface and attempt to start the SSH service.
